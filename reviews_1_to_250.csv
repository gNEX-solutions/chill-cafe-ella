I tried the mix Sri Lanka food in banana leaf, I really liked it, I especially loved and recommend ""mango chutney"". Even if it is not served with a dish you can ask for it. It goes really very good with meat. I also tried hamburger. I loved the spicy patty, it was not just meat, salt and pepper like the ones in classical burger, you should try it. Also people working here are cool and chill people. Vidal was very good to me, he is nice and helpful person."
,,,,,
kyanashyanne,"Pannipitiya, Sri Lanka",4-Sep-19,50,"Best value, best service, and great atmosphere","Cafe Chill is honestly one of the best places to have a meal if you want great value for money and excellent service quality. From the moment you step through the entrance and into the restaurant, you genuinely feel calm. The interior design is well done and makes you feel intrigued as to what's on the menu, and rightfully so! Cafe Chill is excellent if you are not sure what you'd like to eat because it ranges from international classics like: English fish and chips, Greek style fish with artisan bread, German inspired chicken schnitzel, to local cuisines, and more. If you prefer a more local palette, the lamprais is a must and is very popular too.
Furthermore, my partner and I will both agree that if there was ever an ""Employee of the Month"" award, it should definitely go to Vidal. He service was excellent, and his positive attitude was contagious. He went out of his way to ensure that our dietary requirements were met, and even recommended substitutes for those we could not handle.
The food itself was excellent and there was nothing I could honestly say that we didn't enjoy."

sithira_thinula,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",31-Aug-19,50,Out of this world,"Ella, Sri Lanka is a laid-back town in the central hills. For local travelers it is not a preferred destination. But, once you go there, you will find that the Ella tourist area is out of this world. Amid cool climes it offers a unique architecture with multi-story restaurants done using wood, coconut & palm leaves. The ambiance is so exciting. Among the restaurants, The Chill Cafe stands out. As the name implies, it is a great place for chilling. Up-stair all wooden building creates a lovely environment. You have to remove your shoes if you are going to sit upstairs and that gives you a very relaxing feeling. Food variety is amazing. Their detox drinks can't be found even in 5 star hotels. Different food have distinct tastes, the portion sizes are substantial and reasonably priced. Staff is very courteous though they are mega-busy. Real value for money. You won't regret visiting this restaurant."

Sathis d, ,23-Aug-19,10,I was cheated,We went to Cafe Chill for lunch a few days ago. I ordered a lumprijs while my two colleagues ordered sandwiches. After about twenty minutes what the waiter served me was not a lumprijs but a packet of rice and curry. When this was pointed out the waiter slipped away murmuring something. I should not have eaten what I was served. But I am not the quarreling fussy type. Since we were already late on our work I decided to have what I did not order. It was bland rice and curry with undercooked rice. The only positive element was that it was warm. They should have told me that lumprijs was not available. I would have had something else. Why did they want to cheat a customer who thought this Cafe would be trustworthy. Very bad game of money-making.

We ordered the tasting curry served with rice in banana leaf - it was dry and all mashed up like dog food. Flavour was bland and very underwhelming which is unusual as Sri Lankan food shouldn‚Äôt be that hard... we are in Sri Lanka after all! It just tasted like dry white rice with a whole lot of crap mixed through. Ended up paying the bill and left. Cocktail was nice.

- No footwear upstairs! There is an area where you take off your foot wear so it feels like you are home. Very comfortable and relaxing
- the staff (service and kitchen) are super friendly, fast
- the food is great! Burgers, pizzas, drinks, shakes... we all enjoyed the food. The flavour of the meat in the burger was exceptional! The espresso shake was amazing and the potato wedges were fantastic. All three highly recommended! Overall the menu prices are higher than typical Sri Lankan restaurants. Expect to pay closer to European, North American prices. But it‚Äôs a nice break if you are looking for more western meals - and the quality is quite good.

Things we thought were ‚Äúmeh‚Äù:
- portion sizes are a little on the smaller side. Especially the french fries. This is a minor quib and maybe something they can work on. All in all, the food was great.

They take reservations so you should book a spot upstairs with the bean bag cushions near the front looking over the street. It‚Äôs the most chill place in the restaurant!

Bottom line, this is a place worth coming, if not for the food and drinks then for the vibe and atmosphere! Our family loved it. The name says it all and it truly lives up to it."

ATB1WP,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",14-Aug-19,50,A must-do.,"We arrived early (5.15pm) in the hope of getting a table at the front. Forget it! This place is busy all day but there always seems to be a table available. We ended up upstairs, right next to the stairs, so could see everyone‚Äôs food as it came up from the kitchen. Everything looked good. We had the curry of the day and the ‚Äúlampais‚Äù (pronounced ‚Äòlump-rice‚Äô) which was fabulous...a whole heap of curries and chicken wrapped in a banana leaf and baked. Delicious. Highly recommended."

Dinesh, who took our order was super polite and helped us by conveying our instructions to the chef and we got our food just the way we wanted it. We ordered prawn curry on toast, chicken lumprais and chicken curry and rice. The taste was really good, especially the prawn curry on toast, just loved it! Smoothie can be improved for sure but wasn't that bed to compel me to cut a rating point. The coconut ice cream at the end was ! A must visit when in Ella.
But hey, be prepared for a lot of noise as the place is packed."

alwaysluckey,"Kandy, Sri Lanka",11-Aug-19,50,Wonderful,Nice place to visit while in town. This is a very popular place. It had a line out side so we went somewhere else for a little and came back got seated quickly. Up stairs is the place to be. It's a barefoot bar and they have cubbyholes for your shoes but not enough because when its packed everyone takes off their shoes and create a pile. As we were there we had some magnificent drinks at the bar. They also had beanbags near too. If your luckey you can snag one. Only thing that sucked is that the beanbags were so comfortable some people were sleeping at the later hours so maybe some staff and keep an eye out and give them a jab.

currymonster37,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom",9-Aug-19,40,Great place to hang out,"We really loved Cafe Chill and visited 4 times during our 2 day Ella stay which says something. Great upstairs, comfy beanbags to sit on and listen to the cool vibes. Excellent cocktails and the best passion fruit and mint iced tea! Our food on both occasions was good (fish sandwich, devilled chicken and burgers) however I had the stir fry chicken which was really disappointing as the rice was over cooked and there were slices of potatoes with the veg, not particularly authentic for a Asian stir fry and made it taste soft. The staff are super friendly and they take credit cards too!"

lisaluise19,"Vienna, Austria",9-Aug-19,30,"Great location, but rather touristy","The location is great and the building is impressive, however the food is rather western and a little bit expensive.

However we found the rates are higher than 360 degree restaurant and also the choice is less than 360 degree restaurant.

This is just to encourage them to serve better for the deserving traveler as these places made Ella the best location or best destination.

He was obviously very hard working, and the place was jam packed full so we were lucky to be put on a table of 6 with a couple guys from Switzerland. The red wine I had was warm and delicious, the cocktails were banging! We shared a pizza which was so so good, wish we had bought 2! We ended up having the best boozy night with these guys and moved to the upstairs bar which is beautiful and takes you away from the view of the main road. They have a late night 10pm-2am menu which is such a great idea. This is definitely a place you can lounge around for hours and have a great night in. See you tonight!"

Our server Rumesh put us at ease and was very helpful.
We had a lovely meal at Cafe Chill , my wife had the burger to make a change from the traditional Sri Lankan curry and rice, she said it was very nice. When in Sri Lanka I feel you can never have too much curry and rice so
I went for the Lumprais , which is where you get your Currys cooked together wrapped in banana leaves, and I must say it was delicious . If you are staying in or near Ella Cafe Chill definitely worth a visit.

The food was great! We ordered their signature rice & curry, it was delicious! I can‚Äôt remember exactly what it was called but it was wrapped up in a banana leaf!

They have a great drinks menu too, think we cleared them out of all their gin and vodka cocktails and definitely felt it the next day! Pretty sure we made ourselves look like right idiots, mainly me thinking I was Ariana Grande giving them a live rendition till close. They were really friendly and attentive throughout (my performance!)

carlosbA4567YZ,"Moscow, Russia",19-Jun-19,50,Lovely atmosphere and delicious food,"Some friends suggested us to come to this place and we loved it. We spent 3 nights in Ella and we came here for dinner every night. The stuff is extremely kind and friendly. We wanted to order food when kitchen was closed and the waiter talked with the chef so we could have dinner so our experience was so far so good here.
The place, the music the atmosphere.. Everything was very pleasant and actually, you could see most of the few tourista in the town gathering there for dinner.
Food was very tasty and they serve either Sri Lankam dishes and international ones so we really enjoyed to something else apart from rice&curry in the menu after 2 weeks travelling in Sri Lanka and eating in local restaurants.
Just keep in mind that as this place has Western standards so do prices so if you are ttavelling on a budget go sonewhere else."

kellykelly15, ,10-Jun-19,30,Average,"Food was grand, nothing special... The kitchen garden was 10 times better for half the price. Was a nice busy atmosphere for a weekend night. One massive negative from the night was that the staff here in Ella rock seemed to allow a young group of travelers to get absolutely hammered and encourage them to sing the same song for 30 mins straight, was quite comical for the first 10 mins then the next 20 mins was annoying especially while ella rocks own speakers where blaring music.... The end of that story was the young group of travelers eventually got into a fight on the streets in ella with some of the locals. Which the staff from ella rock done what they could to diffuse the situation, but the damage was done a good hour beforehand feeding them drink, when they should have been politely told to leave and go to bed."

You can sit in comfy beanbags upstairs for a drink or to eat, and the prices aren‚Äôt even expensive. I was here two weeks ago as well, and the staff remembered me and welcomed me with a smile and shook my hand when I entered the restaurant. I was served by Sampa today, a genuinely nice guy!

The Chicken Lumprais was delicious. So much more flavourful than any Sri Lankan curry or Kottu I've had so far.

The Sri Lankan Special cocktail wasn't bad either. Better than other cocktails I've had in Ella at bigger restaurants (the kind you'd expect to have a decent cocktail...I'm looking at you UFO).

And finally, feeling somewhat adventurous I got the Palm Honey and Buffalo Curd desert. It was so incredibly smooth and creamy. It was like a buttery yoghurt tower drizzled in syrup."

traceyhW6114KJ,"Adelaide, Australia",23-May-19,50,Great place to relax,"We usually tend to go to more underdog restaurants for supporting local families rather than touristic hotspots and places which are not trying to impress foreigners by looks and its hipness
Yesterday we were in the mood to eat something else than the typical Sri Lankan menu so we went to chill and everything was perfect :)) very nice staff (especially Rasika), nice atmosphere and good music, i loved my drink (homemade mint ice tea) & the food was delicious
So compared to the other places we usually go to it was very $$$ but also it was worth it :) recommended!"

Charlston22, ,22-May-19,50,Fantastic food and a great place to relax,"So we have been in Sri Lanka for 5 days now, and Chill is by far our favourite place we have eaten. Not only do they do a variety of international dishes (the pizza is amazing) but their Sri Lankan dishes are really good! we were recommended here by our driver and have been back twice in the last 24 hours! Amazing building, all made of bamboo, and the service was great (Upul in particular made us feel really welcome) Many people have cancelled their trips to Sri Lanka since the bombings, but we have loved every minute and felt safer here than in the UK, the people are friendly and always wanting to help you."

Not only is the Sri Lankan food amazing, but the salads and pasta and desserts are also excellent. The four of us had many different meals over the two days we ate there and they were all delicious. And the passionfruit mojito....yum. The service, vibe, music, the cool breeze wafting through the open top floor and of course the food, kept us coming back. A special shout out to the excellent Dimish, one of the trainee waiters. Great work!"

Budapest81,"Szazhalombatta, Hungary",11-May-19,40,Good pizza,"The place is rather for international food (burgers, pizza) than local. Beer is cold, pizza is good (Italian thin style). Very busy place, it's always full. The music is loud a bit. It's not a good place to just sit and think or read; there are too many people and noise for that."
,,,,,
Fandango11,Southampton Uk,11-May-19,50,"Great bar, good food.","By the time we got to Ella we had eaten quite a lot of Sri Lankan curry so we decided to have a change. This bar is packed every night, and for good reason. First night we had fish and chips and a burger. the fish and chips was excellent, the burger pretty good. Second visit my Wife had fishfingers which were enormous and I had the spicy pizza, both of which were excellent.. Considering how busy it was the service was excellent and the beer prices very reasonable. If I had a complaint it would be that the cocktails tasted as though they had been waved near a botle of booze rather than had it poured in making them very expensive, but tasty, fruit drinks. This is very common in Sri Lanka, so it's better value to stick with the beer."
,,,,,
Mitcho_uk,"Leicester, United Kingdom",10-May-19,50,Great food and chilled out vibe,"A great place to chill out in Ella after hiking Ella Rock or Little Adams Peak. It has a good array of well priced drinks and some great food options. I would highly recommend the Lamprais (Lump Rice) or Sri Lankan Curry, Pizzas looked decent too.

We were served by Rasika on a couple of occasions, who was really friendly and attentive. Well worth a visit."

Friendly staff, always busy but the space is large so it should be ok to find a table also at rush hour as we did. Consider 30mins in this case for order to be prepared, but that is also standard everywhere in the country!"

gavin_r_h9,"Kandy, Sri Lanka",5-May-19,50,A warm atmosphere,"Cafe Chill is easily found, central to Ella town. It's a fabulous place to sit down with friends and chat over a meal. Although, it's popularity does mean that it will fill up fast close to dinner time so it may be wise to get there slightly early. As the evening grows, Cafe Chill developed a warm, cozy atmosphere with patrons voices filling the air and the occasional, well-behaved feline trotting in between the tables. The food and drinks were freshly prepared, delivered to our table fairly quickly and as spicy as one requires. Rumesh did a great job of keeping an eye on our table and making sure we had everything we needed. His knowledge of the menu was great in helping us decide just what we wanted and the resulting meal was just right.
All in all, it was an experience worth recommending in Ella."

Jo E,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",4-May-19,50,Great lumprais!,This is a great spot on the main street in Ella that was recommended by our guide. It is certainly popular as was very busy but the service was great and the food/drink was too. I had the 10 curry lumprais which was so tasty and hubby had the schnitzel that he raved about! Tables are quite close together but that meant we ended up chatting to the next table for the duration of our visit which was great for us!

He looks really chill but works very hard and still is very kind and paying attention. First we sat on the bar, before he helped us to get one of the best spots of the restaurant.

georgiar969,"Sydney, Australia",26-Apr-19,50,Good vibes,"We loved our dinner at Cafe Chill during our visit to Ella in March. We were excited to go after seeing the great reviews. Because we were staying at Chill Ville hotel (same owner), we were able to get an excellent table at Cafe Chill and special service and a round of drinks as well!
We thought the food was great, loved the pizzas and lamprais and soup, as well as the cocktails.
Service from Vidal was absolutely standout- he was incredibly friendly and helpful and despite how busy the restaurant is, food and drinks arrived promptly.
Like many others, we returned again the following night and had just as great a time."

noemig650,"London, United Kingdom",23-Apr-19,50,Extraordinary,"One night we were looking for a place to have a couple of drinks. Chill was the only place after 10pm we could do that.

We had a couple of cocktails ( was not my taste) then we tried the Sri Lankan ""brandy"", Arrack.

Our waiter, Vidal, was still full of energy, he was super friendly and funny.
We promised will go next day for dinner but the weather was so bad and our accommodation was very far, we skipped that.

Third day was our last day in Ella, after all the hiking and tours we decided to have a light lunch before dinner at Chill again. We shared a pizza, and honestly can say was one of the best I ate outside Europe.

Thankfully Vidal was there, we sat in his section, but he was so busy could not really chat. Vidal is a very friendly guy, speak very well English, honest and seemed full of life. If you are there look for him Hope one day we can meet again :) Thank you for your service it was a real pleasure to meet with you."

marloushaze,"Trincomalee, Sri Lanka",23-Apr-19,30,"Nice food, but busy and $$$","This was a nice restaurant that served Western food and knew what gluten free was
However it is always extremely busy and noisy with all the people. Some like this atmosphere, we didn't.
Food was ok, standard burgers or pizza or pasta. Nice for a change away from Sri Lankan curry and rice.
In terms of cost, there are far better value for money restaurants in Ella bit I guess if your choosing to go here it is because you want some Western food and you'll have to pay more for it as a result.

We went to the 3rd floor, removed our footwear, like everyone else and ‚Äúchilled‚Äù on the big bean bags over looking Ella‚Äôs rock. The buzz in the place was the best in Sri Lanka. The food is great, the detox juices are so refreshing and the cocktails very fresh. Can‚Äôt recommend enough, kid friendly too.

snowgirl3,"Bangkok, Thailand",15-Apr-19,40,Lots of choice - western and SL,"Good range of food on the menu - pizza, burgers, curry, wedges etc.
A few salad Options but the tuna salad comes with pasta which seems a bit silly when you want salad as a healthier choice or if your gluten free. But, portion size was good.
zucchini salad with cashew sauce (vegan option) was better than expected and good portion. The potatoes wedges are homemade and huge.
If you want some western style go here. Total bill 3000 with a ginger beer and green juice."

The food was pretty good. There's a god mix of local, British and Italian food to choose from. The bar menu is not extensive, but the drinks are not expensive.

Definitely worth a visit, but be early, or book ahead."

It has a vibrant, buzzy feel and is often busy - testament to how good it is. The menu is much more varied than many places with Sri Lankan and Western options - the lumprais (ten types of curry in a banana leaf) is definitely worth a go. On top of that I assume they have a back up generator as the cooking, music and free WiFi didn‚Äôt stop even during one of the many power outages in the area. Would definitely recommend!"

Hamsta666, ,4-Apr-19,50,Tasty food AND atmosphere!,"I have been travelling through 7 different destinations around Sri Lanka, and this is by far the tastiest food I have eaten. I should stop the review at that. But I won't.
The atmosphere is great as it is always busy and friendly (families too) and the food & drinks are unbelievable. The lamprais is a bit like a biriyani and is gorgeous with a generous amount of chicken, right amount of spice, and flavours from all directions! The pizza, prawn curry, and sweet and sour dish are going to be my next ones for sure!"

Sara N, ,4-Apr-19,40,Nice place with good lumprais,"Really nice place with good food and friendly staff. Especially Rasika served us in a nice and friendly manner.

KarenBonavita,U.S.,1-Apr-19,20,"Touristy, our dish poor quality","Sorry, do not recommend. Nice atmosphere, excellent servers, but our dish was NOT representative of Sri Lanka quality. The Sri Lanka dish was supposed to have a variety of chilies and be hot and spicy; I could smell ketchup, it was not hot, chicken over cooked, ridiculous amount of peppers, and the fruit drink that was to have a variety of fruits just tasted like lime - not recommended."

otarabrowns,"Invercargill, New Zealand",31-Mar-19,30,Could be anywhere,This was a centrally locates place but was very generic and could have been at any tourist resort town in the world.

They have around 150-200 seats but this place is mad busy. The atmosphere is buzzing, felt like a club!

The only issue is upon ordering, it took them 25 minutes or so to make the burgers, I understand it‚Äôs busy but 25 minutes felt like a long time! Anyhow, this place still gets 4 stars from me, if they manage to speed up their service then they would be a perfect 5 star! Keep up the good work guys."

AaronC3359, ,27-Mar-19,30,Cafe chill is definitely not chill,"My wife and I decided to try cafe chill out due to the numerous (5000+) reviews. When we arrived, it was packed, noisy and jam packed with every tourist imaginable.
Staff was courteous, lighting was dim, we were ushered to our seat at the back of the restaurant. The seats and tables were very close to each other with not much wiggle room.
We ordered a Lion beer and detox juice. Juice was nice according to my wife.
We then ordered a vegetarian pizza and beef burger. The pizza was good. The beef burger was very average to be honest.
We'd have hoped that it was a nice place to chill out but frankly it was anything but chill."

K1917ORsarahn,"London, United Kingdom",27-Mar-19,20,Over rated touristic stop,My husband and I were underwhelmed by cafe chill. A crowded touristic destination which I would say can be missed.

He was truly exceptional; his suggestions, attention to detail and overall attitude and demeanor are all qualities which so many the works over lack. He's cool and knows his business; an asset wherever he works so look after him.

Kudos to all the bar and floor staff. You guys run a tight ship.

I believe the place has a good success also due to the fact that it's mentioned and recommended by some well known travel guides, but there are certainly better places in town for authentic Sri Lankan food."

Awful experience... and by the way it seems that we were the only couple asked to move (we saw several in tables of four people)"

We were fortunately seated but the street so have a view of the goings on and a nice breeze.

As this was a more western restaurant we opted for the schnitzel and a pizza and were very impressed at the quality and taste of the food. We also ordered a side of potatoes wedges which were amazing. The main meals were around 1000 Rupee each which was not all for most dishes and the wedges were 400.

The service was very prompt and weren‚Äôt trying to get rid of you to turn the table which was nice."

We had a lunch here too, which was good and very fast. Toilets are very nice, comfy beanbags overlooking the street, unobtrusive music. Special shout out to our waiter on all occasions, Sampa.

w1py,"London, United Kingdom",16-Mar-19,30,"Busy restaurant, ok food","There is a reasonable selection of food options including Sri Lankan and international dishes. However, the restaurant is heaving with tourists and you may have a wait. This is reflected in the prices which is high for Sri Lankan standards.
We had the pizzas, which were ok. I was disappointed by the tuna on my Cafe Chill Spicy pizza.
Service is v good considering how busy they are. I was slightly put off by the roaming cat and dog around the tables.
There must be better cheaper places to eat, but this could be a safe option."

Food here is nothing special though it was nice to enjoy the western music and vibes. However, if you're looking for authentic Sri Lankan experience and cuisine, I would pass on Cafe Chill. Prices are 1.5 to 2x what you'd pay for their Sri Lankan dishes compared to other restaurants in Ella and to me there are loads of better Sri Lankan places to eat breakfast/lunch/dinner."

K83792, ,13-Mar-19,20,Squashed dinner,We visited chill based on recommendations and we were very disappointed.

Besides the local cuisine they also serve a variety of western dishes, handy if you feel like having a break from the SriLankan spicy food. The ambient is great with chill atmospheric music and lighting with top floor definitely the best. They are mostly full at lunch and dinnertime but the place is quite big so you won't have problems finding a place to sit. We were impressed how the staff handled the crowded floor, they were always at the right place when needed. They were very kind and helpfull with our gluten free member of the party doublechecking the ingredients with the chefs. The food was delicious and, without a doubt, very fresh as is expected for a restaurant with such a large turnover. The house Seafood Spaghetti was the best I ever had, very rich in ingredients and flavor! Their Lumprais was also finger-licking delicious. Mohito and homemade Ice tea were beautifully prepared! The place definitely deserved our recomendation!"

Wow! All the waiters are cheery, English speaking, fast, very hardworking and brilliant at really connecting with you and enjoy serving up the food ( cooked by a strong team of chefs in a fast moving open kitchen) and also wonderful fruity and alcoholic drinks. Gihan was our favourite and from Day 1 we clicked with him. He joined in with our cheeky humour and also recommended some other excellent Sri Lankan restaurants as well. However, regardless of where we ate we always returned to Chill later on to seek him out again.
Gihan not only offered great service with high energy often all day and into the night but also showed intelligence, humour, initiative and made time to recommend ideas to make our day more fun. Gihan has all the skills, fantastic work ethic, intelligence, care and sincerity to go far in his career and is an asset to Cafe Chill."

Most of Sri Lanka already has slow service but it gets ridiculously busy at Chill especially from dinner time until closing. The staff cannot keep up. It's best to come here earlier in the day if you want better service. Also, the water in the bathroom didn't work at all each time we were there."

pinkerrific,"Sydney, Australia",5-Mar-19,40,Loved it!,"Loved the whole concept of great chill music as a backdrop to wooden floors, shoes off, big tv screens and beanbags (as well as regular chairs and tables). The decor is so great and the service absolutely excellent. Had some of the best service here in our whole 2 weeks in Sri Lanka. It is a drawcard for backpackers and hip young things so we were lucky to strike it when it wasn't too busy. That said their was a french family with 2 exuberant boys who kept pounding out of their bean bags and running all over the place. With wooden floors everything tends to shake a bit which was a tad unpleasant. Nice menu but very limited choices given how much western food is listed in it. We didn't go to Sri Lanka to eat western food. We both ordered the prawn curry and I checked the heat level first - not spicy at all madam I was told. Well holy moly it packed a punch! But is was just so deliciously full of flavour that I was determined to conquer my wimpy taste buds and soldier on. The waiter was so apologetic and raced off to procure some yogurt. The vanilla probiotic yogurt was very odd but a mango lassie followed which was perfect and I finished most of it. The lassie and yogurt was complementary. The cocktails were also fabulous and I could imagine spending an afternoon here, drinking and grazing, should I be stuck in Ella for any length of time. There really isn't anything in Ella - just the end of the train line and this great cafe."

kathymE5210IR,"Calgary, Canada",5-Mar-19,30,Just ok,"During our travels in Sri Lanka, we found that if you order traditional/native dishes, you will almost always have a better experience than if you order ""western"" food. In the case of Cafe Chill, we actually found that neither was good. My fiance ordered Sri Lankan food and I had a chicken burger (I was having a hankering for fries!). They weren't very tasty and was dry and flavourless. Cafe Chill definitely had the most lively vibe of all the restaurants on the busy strip (made for tourists) so that sort of made up for the mediocre food. Our experience was not what was advertised in the Lonely Planet! Would not go unless you're looking for a lively spot and drinking establishment."

iyavill,"Los Angeles, California",5-Mar-19,50,A Must Stop in Ella,"We ended up at Chill Cafe the first time per our driver‚Äôs recommendation. It may seem touristy but we loved the ambiance (make sure to go to the top level), the food (try the traditional Sri Lankan dishes), and the service! Nisha, our server was the best! He was attentive, friendly, and gave us recommendations that were on point! We happened to be in the area the next day and just had to stop by Chill Cafe again. Nisha helped us again with our quick to-go/takeaway orders. Thanks, Nisha, for going over and beyond to help us out. Much appreciated!"

worldfamilyadventure,"Manchester, United Kingdom",1-Mar-19,50,Nice vibe and good selection of food,"This is a pretty cool but very busy place. Its difficult to get a table - you just have to go in and grab one. We had a lovely time and enjoyed our meal. I had a Sri Lankan mixed curry which was in a banana leaf. The rest of the table had a break from Sri Lankan and opted for pizza, spaghetti and a burger. All was great.
Its a good place to go for a change from local food or budget places but it was a bit expensive for us."

SamAndCrakes,"Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom",1-Mar-19,40,Fine,"Nothing special but a decent option amongst the many similar places on Ella‚Äôs strip. They didn‚Äôt offer any option for drivers to eat a small or ‚Äúlocal‚Äù meal but that‚Äôs the norm in Ella which is really just a place for white backpackers.

Would have given it a 3 but compared with the other places in Ella (not elsewhere in SL) a 4 is probably fair."

Kleinkaufm23, ,28-Feb-19,50,Vidal is the man !!,"I visited Sri Lanka back in November 2018 alone and at first it was hard to find a place to really hang out in Ella but then I stumbled upon ‚ÄúChill‚Äù and I‚Äôve never been happier that I did. The variety of food and drinks there are awesome and the atmosphere was superb - the upstairs lounge area with bean bag chairs made it an awesome area to mingle with other passing tourists and watch the latest cricket game.
Although all of that made that place great, what really made that place awesome was the local staff. ( A few to name) Yoga & Giahn were two really great servers I had frequently and were outstanding, but the guy who really made my experience the best and is the reason I yearn to go back there again and visit was Vidal.
He knew I traveled alone and the moment I took my shoes off at the top of the stairs he welcomed me with a great smile and awesome vibes from the first day I went there, to the very last. Not only was he an extremely hard worker, but he made everyone feel so welcome, including me and I can‚Äôt wait to find myself back at Chill Cafe once more.

catchourdrift,"Manchester, United Kingdom",28-Feb-19,30,Flavourless,"Extremely average and flavourless food by Sri Lankan (or any) standards. We had the Lumprais which is meant to be a ‚Äúmouth watering mix of 10 different curries‚Äù wrapped in banana leaf. It looked great but it was just some dry rice with no spices and some chicken, no curry that we could taste or any other flavour of note. The athmosphere was nice and the staff very friendly, but there is MUCH better food on offer elsewhere in Ella."

Look4wrd, ,27-Feb-19,10,Not so chill,"Go here if you are looking for a safe, formulaic corporate dining experience that might remind you of home if you are visiting from the West. We found it to be crowded, noisy, smoky, trendy and the food to be mediocre. Sri Lanka has some amazing curries and cuisine. Seek out some tiny resultants that serve authentic Sri Lankan dishes. Don't come here looking for that. If you want Western food, alcohol and a scene this may be to your taste."

Both were warm at best! After finally getting food that was vaguely what we ordered the bill took another 30 minutes. Other tables seemed to getting food as planned etc so think we were just unlucky!"

It was crazy busy, I was worried we wouldn't get a table but two of the serving staff told us not to worry and got us beers while we waited. Ramesh really looked after us. We had a few unusual requests in terms of sharing mains as a starter and delaying the main course but he had it all under control! There is a very wide selection of cuisines all prepared fresh by an army of chefs in the open kitchen. It's the only restaurant I've seen where the waiting staff could hardly keep up with the chefs!

We gave it another try a few nights later and had better luck. We aat in the top floor by the bar. Great ambiance and great for people watching.

150dwaynem,"Box Hill, Australia",12-Feb-19,30,At least the espresso was good,"Went in here because of TripAdvisor reviews. From what we experienced someone must have bribed the 5's. Food is average and mostly poor imitations of western food. Ok if you're sick of curry and rice I guess but C'mon you're in Sri Lanka. The espresso was good, coming from a Melbournian who is spoiled with great coffee, this is a compliment. Do not order anything with milk though if what you want is a nice caffeine hit. Plenty of tourists there but probably because of the reviews here. There are enough other eateries in town that mean you can dodge this place without worrying that you have missed out on anything. Try The Garden Kitchen or Mateys instead."

Chilled vibe created by 'shoes-off' practice on the top floor, acoustic background music and an awesome building. Food was amazing and there was lots of choice. Place looks busy from the outside but there are three floors so it's not too hard to find a table. Employees are friendly and attentive. Loved having lunch and playing cards at this place."

Mehmet H,"Hyderabad, India",9-Feb-19,50,Mem,I went there with my Sister based on the comments we saw here and I was impressed by the service and the ambiance. We went there twice and we were served by the same waiter named Saman who was a very helpful and lovely guy. I appreciate his help. I can recommend this restaurant/bar/cafe while you are in Ella. They are famous for their local food which is served with banana leaf (sorry I forgot its name and didn‚Äôt take a photo as I was trying to live in the moment :). We had the vegetarian option (different curries were mixed on rice sealed in banana leaf and oven baked) which was very tasty. Also their pumpkin soup (comes with very large bowl) and veggie burger. Overall it is a nice place and probably must see ambiance in Ella. Thanks

Michael M,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",9-Feb-19,50,"Great meal, service and ambiance","This restaurant has it down. The place seems to always be hopping and it can accommodate families pretty well in the back of the ground floor with 3 big table options. Also, it‚Äôs a bit removed in the back so the noise of loud kids is not too disruptive. The restaurant also has a sweet upstairs area but we didn‚Äôt dare bring or tribe up there because the vibe was too ‚ÄúChill‚Äù as the name suggests and we didn‚Äôt want to disrupt.

The service is good. All the guys are hustling around, well trained and hard working staff. Orders are taken swiftly (be ready when they approach) and the drinks and food arrive timely. Good list of solid tasting cocktails with infused alcohols.

My $.02 - You could put this restaurant in any market and I think it would hold its own.

I think for Ella‚Äôs it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmust‚Äù and you can‚Äôt come here without paying the ‚ÄúChill toll‚Äù or so it seems (we actually went twice because of the ease and quality)."

alicef675,"Leeds, United Kingdom",8-Feb-19,10,Tried to rip us off,"Came here and had average service and two burgers which were ok. He brought us the wrong bill and told us he had added fried chicken by accident and would deduct it (leaving on the extra service charge). When we told him it was the wrong bill, he then brought our bill which he had also added fried chicken on and then removed the cost of the item but not the service charge.

This is clearly a con they do for everyone and has happened to us a few times in Ella. Restaurants add extra items so they can rack up the service charge and then just deduct the cost of the items. Bit of a shame.

Make sure to check to your bill in Ella!"

Durabil,"Whitehorse, Canada",8-Feb-19,50,Do not miss,"Chef Nadeeka presents a menu that not only reads deliciously but is even better when you savour the first bite.

I was a bit skeptical to try Chill because I didn‚Äôt see a lot of locals and the restaurant was littered with western tourists. They all seemed very very happy so I thought I would give it a try. I had the rice and curry of the day and my taste buds felt like they were singing the Star Spangled Banner. My friend is from Sri Lanka and he said it was a great place as well. Upul was our waiter and his service was amazing, friendly and even answered a few local questions about my itinerary.
This has been by far my best meal in Sri Lanka. Go here and ask for Upul. He will make your day."

ClaudiaHH_13,"Zurich, Switzerland",20-Jan-19,40,"very popular, efficient service, ok food","The Chill Cafe is a restaurant which is extremely popular in Ella and one wonders why with that amount of offer. The answer is of course in part because it is quite nice, but also because if offers free food and a drink to drivers and guides (haha!). This is also why our driver who was not very pushy at all in terms of taking us to restaurants, made a point of bringing us here.
Again, the restaurant is not bad at all, service is efficient and friendly, food is good (albeit not excellent). However for us with a small child it was too busy and a little bit too loud."

princessgloriachin,"Boston, Massachusetts",20-Jan-19,10,Overcrowded tourist trap w/ overpriced bad food,"This place was awful! It was on so many different travel guides and blog posts that I read about but it was just plain bad. Food came out cold, my fish was so over cooked it may as well have been cardboard. It was really busy and packed in there which means they don‚Äôt need your business anymore and probably slack in house since they make so much off of one time tourist visits. This was the most expensive and also worst tasting meal I had during my entire trip.

I normally don‚Äôt bother wasting time writing bad reviews but this place was simply terrible and I don‚Äôt want other visitors to fall for this trap! It was a waste of time, money, and stomach space!! I couldn‚Äôt had a very pleasant Sri Lankan meal but this place robbed me of that opportunity. Ella has no shortage of dining options‚Äî take your money elsewhere !!"

It was juicy and flavorful, served with a small mixed salad and roll. I also ordered the Classic Iced Tea, which turned out to be like an iced tea slush, served in a tall cocktail glass. It did taste like sweet tea as it melted and was cooling on this warm afternoon. Service by my waiter, whose name was Rasika, was attentive and efficient, although the place was quite busy at 3pm. I was happy with my meal and will probably return to this cafe during my stay in Ella."

Schomo,"Zurich, Switzerland",17-Jan-19,50,Food western food,"This restaurant is filled with western tourists. However, this comes due to the nice western food (pizza, burger, ...)

The prices are also higher than local food but in my point of view this is totally fine as the food was good and the atmosphere is very nice"

After seeing a meal which included 10 curries served in a banana leaf we decided to come back for food that evening to try it. The food was tasteless and lukewarm. As some of the photos on here indicate, the dish is a jumble of curries and rice but there were not 10 different curries and it was mostly shredded beetroot and rice. This was the only disappointing meal we have had in Sri Lanka so far."

louloubells12,"Sydney, Australia",15-Jan-19,40,Good local food,"We ate here for a late lunch, looking for something more local than western. A lot of places in Ella seem to focus their menus on western food which is a shame, so we were glad to find some yummy Sri Lankan dishes here. We had the Lumprais which comes in banana leaf and was so tasty! Mains are approx 700-800 LKR, so not cheap cheap if you‚Äôre on a tight budget, but overall we liked it there.

I‚Äôd recommend the Pizzas, they were class. Also the Pineapple-Lime juice is really refreshing.

We had high hopes for the place as it seems very buzzy, but we were really disappointed. We chose to have their specialty Sri Lankan curry presented in a banana leaf, and it was complete style over substance; looked great, tasted meh. There was no flavour at all, which is worrying considering we asked for it really hot and spicy! Definitely the worst food we‚Äôve had so far on our trip."

One of the staff told us that the table behind us were about to leave and we could sit there which was great. They had a good selection of cocktails so we ordered a couple of those and got them very quickly - they were yummy!

For Sri Lankans, their lamprais isn't a wow dish. But for foreigners it's a great thing to try and a get a true taste of the Sri Lankan spices taste.

The staff is extremely helpful and they memorize the order effortlessly.

chloeh169,"Mount Maunganui, New Zealand",6-Jan-19,30,Definitely not Chill,"We came here after a recommendation from a traveler who had come here in September. Perhaps it‚Äôs just due to being this time of the year- but the place was heaving with people and resembled a night club rather than a nice place to eat dinner (which is surprising, given its name!)

Waiters were very kind and hardworking. Unfortunately the food was average (we got vegetarian curry and rice plus a vegetable stir fry).

I do have to say though that our cocktails (passionfruit mojitos) were excellent.

I really can‚Äôt understand why this place is soooo busy - perhaps it‚Äôs a victim of its own success?"

TLaurenM,"London, United Kingdom",6-Jan-19,30,Good western food but not authentic,"We stayed in Ella for 4 days at the beginning of January. We had lunch here twice, but bypassed it for dinner every time. It‚Äôs a good place to go if you want something familiar and ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. Great Greek salad, and they have 2 traditional Sri Lankan curry dishes. My husband had decent chicken burger, although cold... and their deviled chicken was good but really just a chicken stirfry in a sweet and sour sauce. The rest is what you‚Äôd find anywhere in the world - burgers, pizzas, pasta, stirfrys etc. Their lime mint iced tea was mixed with crushed ice and was a highlight.
It‚Äôs good food but crazy busy and hard to get a table, and the service is lacking because it‚Äôs so busy. We also felt it was really ‚Äúfake‚Äù... go all the way to Ella in the middle of the Sri Lankan jungle, to sit in a huge restaurant to eat food you could have at home in the western or European world Not exactly an experience. Better places with better Sri Lankan food and atmosphere a few steps away."

gypsyrocket333,"Mackay, Australia",5-Jan-19,40,Chilled,"The food was fine but nothing overwhelming. The place can get a little too packed for my liking, but they're definitely on the ball, and don't seem to make any mistakes. Prices are fair and if like me missing your wine they sold cheap passable Aussie and Chillean wine at a good price for Sri Lanka."

petule23,"Leeuwarden, The Netherlands",5-Jan-19,50,Surprisingly nice,"We came here on the 31st december for lunch. We were lucky because the place was not really crowded yet. Service was very fast and was good so we thought lets come here also for dinner. We came again early but overall were reservation but we were still lucky to get place for 4 (2 adults and 2 small boys). Our waiter Lahiru was very attend, sweet to the boys and served us very well. Our boys liked him a lot. We had few cocktails (was new year) and they were delicious. Overall very happy with our dinner and evening here. Lahiru thank you for making our evening memorable."

epj123,"London, United Kingdom",4-Jan-19,50,Remarkably and pleasently surprised.,"Upon entering, my initial thoughts were along with lines of 'oh my god this place is rammed' and based on the lacklustre service we have experienced in similar restaurants, 'we will never ever get fed'. How wrong I was. The bulging rable that resembled a queue at the door, spread through the whole lower part of the restaurant and up the stairs, but it was swiftly administered to by the staff, who found a table for us in 15 mins. The clientele is an eclectic mix of families, spangled and bangled middle class back packers, desperate to look the part as they shiver at the grim reality of flannel shirts and librarians jobs back home and couples. The food, comprising of a burger for Mrs J and a devilled chicken, washed down with leveral large lions, arrived promptly and was deliceous. The bill surprisingly deliceous also, very good value for money."

K92UDlauraa,"Nilwella, Sri Lanka",4-Jan-19,20,Quite a disappointment,"The place was very crowded and the staff could clearly not handle it.

On top of that there was a constant sewer smell in our corner."

kavlashah,"Nairobi, Kenya",4-Jan-19,30,Couldn‚Äôt understand the fuss,"Really nice place and insanely packed. Hugely popular place, easily the busiest place in Ella.

However the food was average at best, and we couldn‚Äôt understand why people were queuing for 45 mins for a table.

We ordered soups, pizzas, burger and a Sri Lankan vegetable dish. None of the dishes were great.

Given the hype and how hungry we were, this was one of the most disappointing meals during our trip."

Its great for drinks, upstairs has a great atmosphere and is also a good place to meet other people as you often end up in close proximity to your fellow diners. We also fancied a break from Sri Lankan food and really enjoyed our burgers here. Beers are great and very cold and the cocktails are also pretty good too."

They have a selection of western and Sri Lankan dishes, if which I recommend the chicken burger and the fish and chips. If you still have room for dessert then try to find Udaya and ask him for a banana Lassi!"

The staff is friendly, efficient, and helpful. The food is great and reasonably priced. We ordered chicken Lamprais (cooked in Banana leaves) and chicken curry the first night. The second night we went for burgers. Large Lion beers were 380 rupees and the total bill both nights came in around 2,500 rupees. On a Saturday night when most restaurants seemed to have few customers, the Chill Cafe was packed. It‚Äôs a little noisy and there is sports TV in the bar. So if you want quiet, pick another place."

Kristian_Youness,"Brussels, Belgium",2-Jan-19,10,Overrated,"We had horrible food at Caf√© Chill, maybe because we ordered some western options, like fish and chips, which was made with a dark fish (tuna?) contrary to what was written on the menu.

Terrybloodyberry, ,1-Jan-19,10,Rude and stingy,"Loooonnggg wait and unattentive service aside, they were rude and the food was not even good.

Nothing special on the menu. Burgers, pizza, fried everything.

The chicken schnitzel we ordered was suppose to come with bacon which it did with 4 mini pieces of bacon the size of your small toe nail (look at the pic).

When we told the waiter about it, they said thats just how it is. We can order bacon for extra charge. We had to argue that it‚Äôs ridiculous that a dish that has bacon on the menu came basically no bacon. The waiter said some people dont like bacon.

What a joke! A complete rip off.
Dont go there. I looked around and none of the guests looked happy"

88UK,"Colchester, United Kingdom",1-Jan-19,40,"Busy, decent atmosphere, average food","Cafe chill stands out as you walk through the centre of Ella, it seems to always be busy and has a nice vibe to it. The music is fairly loud and the tables are quite close together so you won‚Äôt have a quiet meal/drinks if that is what you‚Äôre looking for.

It‚Äôs big and tends to look full but walk in, grab a waiters attention and if you let them know you are looking to eat they tend to find a table fairly quickly, we got one straight away last night.

The prices are higher than most places we have visited in Sri Lanka but this may be the same elsewhere in Ella. We both had the Lamprais which was tasty but didn‚Äôt seem so flavoursome or authentic as a lot of other food we have had on this trip. We also struggled to count out 10 different curries in the dish but it‚Äôs possible there were very small portions of some and larger portions of others.

Would definitely visit again for drinks and the atmosphere, tonight we will look elsewhere for food though."

The service here was exceptional. We were amazed at the speed and memory of the waiting staff. The food was enjoyable and fairly priced.

There are tv‚Äôs with sport and I imagine the bar area gets a little rowdier later in the evening.

It looks deceivingly small from the outside, but there's an entire section in the back as well as another floor. It was very busy when we were there, but there was a good atmosphere.

Food was excellent, the lamprais flavoursome and hearty, while the devilled chicken was tasty and a bit spicy. The bruschetta was good as well, fresh tomatoes with pesto. Shout-out to the ice coffee, which was frothy, creamy and delicious.

We were surprised how quick the service was, despite how busy the restaurant was. Food came out quickly and hot. Our waiter Upul was very friendly and attentive, making sure that our experience there was pleasant.

Chill Cafe is definitely worth a visit, don't worry about how busy it looks, the food is great and the service is fast and reliable. Highly recommended."

The whole dinner was awesome; they served a full three course dinner, including soup, turkey dinner of both white and dark meat with potato and veggies and dessert.
The service was excellent and the whole restaurant was jam packed. We really enjoyed the atmosphere of the second floor with a high ceiling of bamboo and a huge wraparound bar for those having drinks only. We highly recommend this restaurant for dinner if you're in Ella."

Massively crowded at dinner time and it took time getting attention at the entrance, getting a table, getting a menu, getting the food.

We enjoyed hanging out here, especially in the afternoon, when it's not too busy. The guys working here are super friendly. Yoga and Vidal are great hosts! They take some time to chat with you and want to make sure you enjoy yourself and the food. Don't go here for rice & curry though. You can get better Sri Lankan food at other places in Ella."

greypen22,"Manchester, United Kingdom",15-Dec-18,30,Target demographic seems to be 18-22,Food mostly western (think pizza or club sandwich). Very average food but good service and a wide range of (slightly overpriced) drinks make up for it a bit. Couldn‚Äôt help but feel a bit old for this place (I‚Äôm 27!).

yulneveroamalone,"Montreal, Canada",14-Dec-18,50,Best place in Ella!,"Cafe Chill, simply put, is awesome! The food is great having eaten there 6 times in our 5 day stay in Ella and trying about half the menu! The chicken burgers are great if you're more into western food and the authentic Sri Lankan dish, Lumprais, was out of this world!! 10 different types of curry served on banana leaf! If that doesn't scream culture, I don't know what does!! The atmosphere is super cool and laid back. We spent 5 hours there one afternoon just lounging on the bean bag chair section of the restaurant ordering multiple appetizers, beers and coffees and just relaxed and soaked in some chill vibes. The staff is cool, accomadating and multilingual! We had the pleasure of being served by Vidal numerous times and he's awesome! You can't miss him, super cool dude with a red ponytail! It's the place in Ella so make sure you stop in on your visit! Jenna & Anthony - yulneveroamalone"

aliciahalarewich,"Tangalle, Sri Lanka",11-Dec-18,30,Ok,"We went here for dinner and got the rice and curry which said there would be a few different curries with rice. When the dish came, the rice and different curries were wrapped together in a banana leaf.

The food we had was pretty terrible especially since Mayey Hut down the street has phenomenal curries for way less money. However, the service was great and we liked the atmosphere. We saw a lot of people with burgers and pizza so we probably just picked the wrong dish."

GeorgieHillier,"London, United Kingdom",4-Dec-18,50,Super chill,The name is very appropriate. Embarrassingly we went 3 times in as many days.

G7329IUjuliak,"Zurich, Switzerland",22-Nov-18,50,Living the Bubble,"We went twice to Chill and the waiters are so attentive as the even recognized us and we had directly our signature spot.
You can get any kind of food there from traditional Sri Lankan Curry to Beef Burgers and Spring rolls. They serve alcoholic beverages and we had Gin Tonic which was good for a change.
They even have a beamer and big screen where you could watch football/ soccer if that's what you are looking for.
It's a good place for a change from the traditional Sri Lanka restaurants and you can dive a bit into your home bubble in a local atmosphere.
Prices are a bit higher than in traditional restaurants but the quality of the food and drinks give justice.
I can def recommend Chill if you are looking for a change while traveling. By the way we also tried the espresso and that was also really good!"

Whoever runs this place has the business sussed from decor to ambience to service. Whether it's for drinks or food you are welcomed immediately and very efficiently. No sitting around for ages waiting for a menu or a drink even when the place is full. It is a model for any restaurant. It's well named and a great place to relax. The menu is a mix of western and Sri Lankan so if, like us, you've had a couple of weeks of curries, albeit good ones, and want a burger and chips (oddly, something we seldom eat at home) then this is the place. Prices are good too. They also serve really good coffee!"

At Cafe Chill we managed a leisurely lunch that really did seem to have something for everyone. We even managed some regrets at having passed on some of the options that we saw at the tables of other diners. The food was good, as was the service. The setting was generally pleasant enough, although as was the case with many open-air Sri Lankan venues, the many flying insects were unwelcome additions."

DicknDan,Gloucestershire,16-Nov-18,20,Food barely average,THis is a really busy restaurant and for the customer it feels like you are on a production line.

If you are in ella this is the place to be. Only problem is the place was overcrowded.That's no surprise given their excellent service. We were served by a young man named SANDADUWAN, who was always in a corner attending to our needs despite the fact the place was  busy.

OllieWinnie,"Manchester, United Kingdom",15-Nov-18,30,Don't be fooled.,A great place to hangout in the afternoons but by dinner time the staff are cramming in as many people as possible. We had to wait for a table to then be squeezed in amongst two other groups. We ate there based on seeing the meals coming out when it was quieter that afternoon and couldn't help but notice how much the portions had slimmed down when we ate (literally half the size). I guess the evening is way busier but consistency is always good.

The staff are very friendly, Vidal looked after us and he was a great guy! We ended up staying for hours and then having dinner. The Sri Lankan food is excellent. Try the laprais, ( chicken and rice curry cooked inside a banana leaf) they are excellent.

One thing you'll notice on your way to this cafe is that there are far too many places to eat around here, some even better looking restaurants, but all empty thanks to Cafe Chill. We were seated on the ground floor, thanks to an open kitchen counter, we had the perfect seat in the house to witness the kitchen staff in action, preparing some delicious looking burgers. You'll find tourists from all countries sitting here, relaxing and grabbing a bite off the most amazing food. I had ordered Devilled Chicken which was tangy and yum, and the quantity was more than decent. My friends had ordered Lamprais Rice, Devilled Prawns and Pizzas.

It was delicious and served from a banana leaf which was nice. We would definitely recommend this place. Really popular among tourists to even go for a smoothie during the day.

AnjaE,"Uppsala, Sweden",9-Oct-18,30,Drinks with lack of taste,"We were driven here by our tuktuk driver the first night but decided to have dinner in a more local SriLankan place (Chill is very western in style). We however went back later as location is good and their upstairs part with bean bags and no shoes policy is nice. The drinks we ordered (Ella special (with arrack) and Ella mule) tasted more or less the same, and did not fulfill the standard you expect given the price."

180pennym,"Exmouth, Australia",9-Oct-18,40,Nice place to avoid the rain,We liked the service in this cafe. Very service oriented. Rasika remembered our orders from the first visit which was nice. We spent a few hours here avoiding monsoon rain and it was very pleasant. The drinks and food is good. The pizzas are especially good. Very creative design of the cafe! Music is also good. Great place to hang out with family and friends!

ryantyson09,"Cheltenham, United Kingdom",8-Oct-18,40,Very Western however good food,Cafe Chill is very much on the western side but with a handful of Sri Lankan dishes as well. The beer is half the price here than anywhere in Sri Lanka from over the last week which is a bonus but I guess it is a little sad to see pretty much everyone in the restaurant ordering a burger or pizza. I had a Sri Lankan curry which was really nice and my girlfriend had a beef burger which she enjoyed but the bread was slightly dry - we have found this is a common problem across Sri Lanka as a whole as well though.

JocelynC885,"Canberra, Australia",7-Oct-18,40,Good place for a cold drink,We stopped here for a break on our drive from Nuwara Eliya to Galle. We both had a lassi - nicely chilled and delicious. The menu had lots food choices - I would have happily stayed for a meal.

Richoooman,"Melbourne, Australia",7-Oct-18,50,A change from pure Lankan food,"This is a cool cafe with heaps of waiters, cocktails on offer and a diverse menu which looked like wonderful Lankan dishes but an array of tasty western food if you feel like a change from curry.

It‚Äôs very popular and seems chaotic but very nice food at the same time."

natsprat80,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",7-Oct-18,30,Exactly as advertised!,Yes there are a lot of back packers here and there are also stray dogs wandering in begging for food. But this place was the busiest and most vibrant of the bars / restaurants in Ella. The staff look after you to ensure you get seated and served quite quickly and the food was cheap and tasty - even the international dishes. Really worth a visit

furmanchikIL,"Chicago, IL",5-Oct-18,20,Staff's disrespect and rudeness is part of the service!,"Chill is usually packed in the evenings, and overall a busy place during the day. However, coming there in the late afternoon has more open tables and spaces. From what we understood, the food is actually good and fresh; however, the service is terrible and I really hope whoever manages the place will read this review
We came there in the late afternoon with our two kids, and my in-laws. We tried to sit down at the 2 tables on the first floor that were available and empty. We were literally kicked out of there, being told that this is prime space and we can not sit here with the kids....
They sent us to the 2nd floor, which was not a prime space, and offered a bigger table for all of us. As soon as we sat at that table, another waiter told us that we could not sit there either, as that table was reserved and asked us to get up and go look for another table, possibly on the 3rd floor, though 3rd floor had no tables for even 4 people.
As we were getting up and going up to the 3rd floor (mind you with 2 kids and 2 elderly people), getting up to move again I did tell the waiter that this is unacceptable to treat people that way, continuously kicking them out in such rude manner, especially with kids and elderly ... to which his response was:"" You Americans always arguing and never listening to anybody else"" and then a hand gesture showing us all to basically ""go to Hell"", which was done in front of my children who heard it and saw it
As we got up to the 3rd floor, my older son told me that he wanted to leave after what he had seen and heard, needless to say that the 6 of us had to yet again get up and leave ...

I would still hope for the owner to read this and at least apologize, let alone improve the attitude of the staff
Please take your business somewhere else, best of all to AK Restoro just a block up the main road, for a wonderful service and delicious food and drinks!"

Western dishes are also available. Staff great and helped us in from the downpour of rain with an umbrella.

Fantastic value for money."

The staff are really happy people who are smiling most of the time. The food is really authentic, and the prices are fair. We tried both the Sri Lankan and Western food and it was both really good. They have a completely open kitchen so you can see that they work very hygienically.

Also very recommendable is the lounging area upstairs, for having some tea or a late night drink!"

coopernffc,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",3-Oct-18,30,Packed in like sardines,"We went for a drink in the evening after eating elsewhere. Drink prices were on the high side, staff were friendly enough. But you lose the atmosphere when you cram as many people/tables into the space as possible, and putting my shoes with 70 other peoples then having to put communal flip flops on to visit the toilet is not hygienic."

Especially on the top deck, people are playing games or working on their journals. It's a busy place so sometimes it takes a while to get your food. They have a variety of local and western food. Definitely worth a visit. We went once to see what all the fuss was about and ended up going everyday! The top deck is far enough from the main street that the sounds don't bother you and you can really.. Chill ;) good cocktails also!"

hannwesty,"Peak Hill, Australia",26-Sep-18,50,Good Vibes,"I came here twice while I was staying in Ella. Great vibe, friendly staff and delicious food. I haven't had a chicken schnitzel in several months and even though it was different to home schnitty's, I loved every mouthful. Not overpriced, but on the more expensive end. This place romps it in in comparison to other nearby restaurants, and the always full house explains why. Its not necessarily better than some of the other places, but when somewhere is full, it draws you in. If you don't like crowds, head to another cafe."

He ate the '10 curry dish' wrapped in a banana leaf with coconut sambal, mango chutney and papadums to accompany the meal. Most meals are very reasonably priced, around or even less than $10AUD. Great vibe with sport on TV's, plenty of atmosphere and friendly waiters. I even believe (please confirm) that they will be showing the AFL grand final on Saturday for us Aussies - go the Eagles!"

adham123,"London, United Kingdom",22-Sep-18,50,"Amazing Place, professionally run, very hip and cool!","Came here for a few drinks first night in Ella grudgingly as it is the busiest place in the strip with all the tourists and backpackers and you feel like an ant going there but it was definitely a good choice. They have the most amazing upstairs bar with tables and chairs and floor cushions everywhere with great music serving ice cold beers and cocktails. Despite it being constantly busy and full of people you never really have to wait around for a drink. Wicked place to meet people. Its a bit pricey but you get what you pay for sometimes. Me and the Mrs liked it so much and saw they had a restaraunt as as well that we came back a few days later to eat. Food was epic. Clean, fresh and very tasty. Serving western and sri lankan food its hard to fault. They have a team of about 10 chefs all cooking and serving up which is cool to see as they are out in the open at the back. Highly recommend this place. A tip for future though is when you go to bar upstairs you have to take flip flop and shoes off and there is a massive pile at the entrance. Try and put them somewhere out of the way or pick them up and take them with you otherwise you might find someone has taken them by accident when you come to get them ;)"

We had a couple of snacks of mozzarella cheese sticks and vegetable springs rolls which were delicious. One annoying thing wAs that the service charge should have been 10% but actually worked out st 13.5% which was a bit naughty. We did challenge them about it and from the reaction knew about it.

However, we tried their signature curry dish wrapped in a banana leaf and were very underwhelmed - there wasn‚Äôt much flavor. That said, we are mega spicy lovers, so maybe they hold back too much for foreigners, hence sacrificing on the tastiness.

The rest of the menu features international food (burgers, pizzas, etc.) and people seemed to be enjoying them. If you‚Äôre looking for a break from Sri Lankan cuisine maybe this is the place for you. Otherwise, go for a more local place."

We shared the 10 curry and rice as a lighter meal and wow was it jam packed full of flavour and not spicy. Sure you could ask for it hot. We had chicken banquette and beef burger for lunch. My husband said the burger was just like my home cooked paddies in Australia. We rocked in for coronas and had a blast with Ranjith. He was fast, fun, efficient, big friendly smile and welcoming.

On top of that, our waiter, Sampa, was extremely friendly and helpful.

It really is a very good spot in town!!!"

Arjan V, ,13-Sep-18,50,Cool place for hot FOOD,Lovely restaurant to have a nice time in Ella. Food and the service was excellent!!! One of the rarest places in Sri Lanka to have typical native food at such high quality. Straws that were used for our drinks were made of Bamboo which was very much innovative and cool but was SMELLY and are been REUSED!!!

ShrutiB289, ,13-Sep-18,40,Europeland!,"While we were taking a walk in Ella, we came across this cafe bursting with light and music! We had to go in. It was absolutely full. So we went upstairs , where they generally serve snacks and drinks. The food was fantastic amd so were the drinks! The place was full of Europians of all ages, just chilling. This is the first time in our trip to Lanka that we realized sri lankans are so much like Indians and that these guys were foreigners to us too!"

So glad we tried it there‚Äôs loads on the menu from traditional to western. There‚Äôs something for everyone on the menu. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs the most popular place in Ella for food and drinks it‚Äôs always busy! I would definitely recommend.

11KushalS,"London, United Kingdom",10-Sep-18,40,Decent food - good atmosphere,"Was hesitant to come here after seeing a bad review that the service is slower towards Indian / coloured. Let me dispel that rumour and say this is not the case. The service was fantastic!! The atmosphere is great and is sort of a hub for the backpacker crowd. Food is good but westernised so if you‚Äôre looking for something spicy, maybe try somewhere else. However the food is still really good!"

BMM1509,"Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom",9-Sep-18,10,Appalling-unsure how anyone could give this place a good review.,Not only is this the worst meal I‚Äôve had in Sri Lanka. It is probably the worst meal I‚Äôve ever had full stop. These positive reviews absolutely baffle me. The service was terrible and describing the food as average is a compliment. You‚Äôre better off spending your money literally anywhere else in the world other than here.

owloAustralia,Australia,8-Sep-18,40,"Good vibe, good value, great people watching","A great place to sit as the sun is going down and watch the mixed bag of humans that are in Ella...get a table at the front, pull up a cold drink and a plate of their delicious warm devilled cashews with chillies and karapincha leaves, and watch the world go by for an hour or two before you eat. A popular hang out, we ate there a couple of times and it was always full.... a good indication of good food/prices/view as many of the other places nearby were nearly empty. They have lamprai and rice and curry options available, and the food is actually really good, big serves and well flavoured, particularly the vegetarian curry plates. A big kitchen churns out massive quantities of food very efficiently. Staff are friendly, the waiter remembered us the second time there and actually brought out bowls of extra chillies and sambals as we had requested the day before as we like our food a little spicier than some. the curries are served at ""Tourist"" spiciness, but very well flavoured, and you can pep them up a bit with a bowl or two of fresh and dried chillies if you want."

JDCF19,France,8-Sep-18,40,European atmosphere,"In this place you will find an european atmosphere, you will find groups of back packers and families. The food is OK/ average (We have tried pizza but I would recommend Sri lankan food). They have a very good variety of drinks and beers. It's a huge restaurant a little bit loud.
They do serve your driver, so it can be a good option for those Sri Lanka."

lancashirescott,"Lancashire, United Kingdom","September 5, 2018",30,"Busy, Noisy, not so chilled out","You walk down the small road in the center of Ella and the Cafe Chill has the most people out of all the cafes and restaurants which is a shame as it‚Äôs not exactly a chilled out place.

Ok it is well set out, the menu is good (western) and the drinks are good too, prices are middle of the road, waiters are abundant, food is good considering the amount of people.

I can‚Äôt really say you‚Äôd go there to chill, the music is just a bit too loud as we struggled to speak with the next table. It‚Äôs so popular that on an evening there is a queue for seating, daytime can be just as busy. It‚Äôs popularity is probably its downfall in one sense as you never seem to be in a space that feels chilled.

Names aside if you want somewhere lively, with music constantly going, good atmosphere but not the chilled kind then it‚Äôs ok."
NicolaTraveling,"Berlin, Germany","September 5, 2018",20,"Loud, too many Western tourists, expensive","I want to be fair: The food is probably pretty good so I cannot say anything against that. We walked out again after 5 minutes cause the music was enormously loud on both floors, Western tourists everywhere (some might like that) and prices for food are pretty hefty. It‚Äòs no place to chill and eat but maybe good for groups who don‚Äôt care about noise and smoke..."

MarkN3373, ,"September 4, 2018",50,Great atmosphere and good food,Chill has 3 levels all with good service and one menu with a mix of local and western food. The prices are reasonable to high and there is a good choice of drinks (including alcohol). At the top level you are asked to take off your shoes but it provides more of a lounge space with beanbags and tables. Even in the low season this place is full in the evening and there is sometimes a wait for a table. Good for groups up to 6 but hard to find seating at night for larger groups.

chris54Hants,hants,"August 24, 2018",30,Busy Place,"Had a meal here while in Ella, the menu caters for most tastes but more western food. so if you looking for traditional Sri Lankan curry I am sure there are better places in Ella but if its pizza and burgers then give it a try.

We both went for Local dishes that were tasty enough, but not as good as some we have had and for a tenth of the cost. It was recommend as the best place to eat in Ella, but i would disagree, more the busiest place.

The Staff (Upul) was great and quick at serving and checking everything was ok.

Over all I would say average but that was due to our selection of food. The pizza or burgers looked great, but didn't travel to Sri Lanka to eat burgers and pizza when in Rome as they say."

The food was really mixed here - good pizza; quite good pasta; average coffee; amazing juices; pretty terrible local food. This last one was the biggest disappointment and surprise!

Gets really busy too, meaning waiters are keen to give you the bill and turf you out as soon as your last bite is in your mouth.

Distinctly average - only come here if you‚Äôre after a quick western bite."
AyeLCee83, ,"August 21, 2018",30,What's all the fuss about?,This place is packed and people line up. Not sure why though. For western dishes? Our Sri Lankan meal was below average. WIFI ordinary.

Jenna1704,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","August 20, 2018",10,Average food and aggressive staff,Tried out Cafe Chill as it is highly rated on Tripadvisor but was very disappointed with the food and especially the service. Standard menu with standard dishes. Don't order the noodles they are just like supernoodles. We ordered the Devilled Fish which was very dry and tasteless. The waiter got our order wrong and insisted that we kept and ate the wrong meal as he couldn't change it and had a 5 minute argument with us insisting on this. Really terrible service - do not expect to be spoken to like that about someone else's mistake. The place is very dark and dingey but if you go upstairs there is a nice rooftop seating area and bean bags to chill out on.

We had the curry wrapped in banana leaf, a total of 10 curries in all with rice. It was a little hard to make out all of the different flavours since they were all somewhat merged together. Quite dry though, it really needed some sauce. Definitely try the devilled cashew nut appetiser, cooked with crispy onions and a bit of a chilli kick. Despite being full, they had lots of chefs and service was fairly quick."

Great for a drink and to chill but maybe avoid the Sri lankan food here and stick to European as the pizza looked great!

The cabana structure and roof is beautiful and the vibe is truly relaxing...a little too relaxing at times though - service is SLOW! But we have found that in many places in Sri Lanka and we thought the food was worth the wait and it was a very good price!

Fresh juices are amazing - they will mix whatever you request - pineapple, passion fruit and banana was my favourite!

The lamprais (a mixture of 10 different curries) MUST BE TRIED! The coconut seasoning is amazing too! Equally, if you‚Äôre ‚Äúcurried our‚Äù their beef burger was the best we‚Äôd had in Sri Lanka.

Shubhankar V, ,"August 16, 2018",10,Racist towards Indians/Colored.,"I found this at a couple of places in Sri Lanka now, Fernando's in Trinco. Here as well, any Caucasian person is immediately greeted and served; not the same if you're colored or brown.

I was given a table by the entrance which made me uncomfortable as I'm a tall guy and it would require me to move out the way a lot. There were a few empty tables inside, which seated four. The kicker is I saw at least 4-5 couples seated on such tables. But when I requested them to change my seating, I was refused twice, stating they wanted to 'do business'.

I can understand this argument if the said time was a peak time with heavy crowds. But I didn't see any reason why I couldn't sit there when so many others were. Finally after insisting again I got a change in table.

Personally, I found that offensive and racist. But maybe it's my perspective. I hope the others who go there have a better experience. Good luck!"

The service was terrible as we walked in nobody showed us to a table and when sat down the area smelt of urine. I told the waiter who laughed at me and just waved his hand over to another area. If it wasn‚Äôt for Rumesh (a trainee waiter he told us afterwards) who caught my eye and was very friendly when he came over we would have left. He was great the whole time
afterwards.

We were very happy with our food and it was a nice change from the traditional food for a night. However, the attitude of the waiters really needs to change to make sure people will come back. It‚Äôs a disappointing change to the usual friendly vibe you get from dining in any other Sri Lankan restaurant.

Waiters are always trying to get tips, checking the bills right after you have paid. This is something really annoying because their attitude with the customers is really fake, it is all about getting tips.

Ranjith was our waiter, he did not take notes of our order and he forgot one salad and he did not even come to say sorry and to check if everything was ok. A different waiter had to fix the problem.

Curiously the tuna salad was really tasty and well balanced. The only good point of our visit there.

The next day I had the cafe chill stir fry which was gorgeous and my boyfriend curry of the day, again buffalo curd for dessert.
We got there early to get seated and by 6.15 both days there was a queue outside the door, which shows how popular it is. The waiter we had both nights was attentive, quick and friendly and the price of our meals was incredibly cheap!

Voyage_Jules1970,"Chester, United Kingdom","July 23, 2018",30,Good place for teenagers and pack packers,"Ella is basically one long street of mostly cafe type restaurants/cheap eats and they all look much the same.

Staying at 98 Acres with 3 teenagers, decided to try Chill due to recommendation. It was 7.30pm and busiest place on strip. But only waited for 10 mins and then we were in.

Restaurant set over 3 floors we were directed to top floor which as far as I could see was best place. Cool and breezy with impressive thatched roof. You have to take your shoes off though so beware, not my favourite thing to do as I‚Äôm a hygiene freak.

Got seated at a low table with bean bags for seating. Wouldn‚Äôt be my preference but went with it as place was heaving and kids liked it. Loud music do not that easy to talk and tv screens up everywhere showing sports. It was a pretty good atmosphere. Full of young people, mostly backpackers......felt a bit out of place at first as I was quite dressed up and it was very casual. After a couple of pomegranates mojitos I settled into it though.

Food was cheap for us as we tend to eat in nicer restaurants wherever we go. Family of 5 meal and drinks about ¬£50. Food was ok, nothing to write home about.....but I think you‚Äôre there more for the atmosphere than anything else.

Went back for lunch next day at kids request.....but in hindsight wish we‚Äôd tried somewhere else. The mediocrity of the good seemed more apparent in the day.

Go enjoy the atmosphere and have a few drinks. Eating in low tables not for me but kids seemed up like it. Don‚Äôt dress up and wash your feet when you get back to you‚Äôre hotel!"

Arul R,"Bangalore, India","July 17, 2018",40,Surprise package,"This was a lil detour from original plan and our driver insisted that we take a stop for a coffee here since we had just had our breakfast and checked out at Nuwara Eliya.

There is this street on Wellawaya road full of coffee shops and eateries and the food and the menu is targetted towards the westerners and bascially this is one place I saw way too many westerners than I did in anyother place in Sri Lanka.

This place has a good old charm about it and most of these cafes are smoker friendly. The food nothing outstanding but is good and you get free WiFi and the speed is uber cool.

The restaurant thou brunch hours was quit busy and had a regular inflow of walkin thou the weather was rainy. Good place to hang out for drinks and finger food if you are in with leisure time."

Ashley P, ,"July 17, 2018",50,"Great place for lunch, dinner or just drinks","We went 3 times during our 3 days in Ella and it was consistently great although always busy and a bit on the pricey side.
We had stir fry veg rice and egg veg Noddles on the first visit at lunch which were both simple but delicious. Both dishes were less than 300 rupees each which are some of the cheapest mains they offer. On the second visit in the evening we had Lamprais (10 curries with rice steamed in banana leaf) for 790 rupees and club sandwich for about 1100 rupees. Both were excellent. On the third visit in evening we had 2 Lamprais dishes. Cocktails are adequate but a bit pricey. Staff are nice and chilled but can take a while to serve you when busy."

Indica D,"Colombo, Sri Lanka","July 17, 2018",40,Chill Experience!,"We arrived late at Cafe Chill only for drinks and mainly wanting to checkout teh place. The roof top bar ambience was really great. Even though all the other premises were all closed by the time we arrived, the bar was still full. The guests seemed to be enjoying themselves alot.

We ordered cocktails and they were served real fast, The quality of the cocktails were also good as well as the prices.

CMLeng,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom","July 16, 2018",30,Nice food but atmosphere not great,The food was lovely but the ambience was not great. The music was too loud and incessant and you could smell the drains from where we were sitting. Not quite as chill as we had hoped.
941stevenw,"Krakow, Poland","July 15, 2018",40,Great dinner!,"Chill Cafe is found in the heart of Ella, on it‚Äôs Main Street - the location was very easy to find and only a short walk from our hotel. When we arrived, we found the location was very busy (we had to queue around 10 minutes to get in), hence it may be recommended to arrive before the main dinner rush at around 7:00pm or after 8:00pm (when it was much quieter). However, this popularity is well deserved!

The venue has a great ambience: the rooftop cocktail bar has a nice atmosphere, and the downstairs seating also was pleasant (with live sport being shown on TV).

From the moment we were seated, our server Vidal was highly attentive and very quick; drinks arrived very quickly after us ordering. Like many places in Sri Lanka, diet versions of soft drinks are not consistently available, but this was no issue to us.

Most of our party ordered chicken burgers; we requested one without salad and one without cheese (both requests which were obliged). The burgers were flavourful and some of the best Western food we‚Äôd had in Sri Lanka thus far - they came with fries and salad, both of which were also tasty. The prices were very reasonable too (850 rupees per burger) - this place is definitely good value for money.

Overall, I‚Äôd definitely recommend this restaurant if you‚Äôre here in Ella!"

After a hard climb onto Ella's Rock we decided to have a short lunch and further relaxing in our room, as the climbing was really hard.
Tell it Karma, or whatever .... Cafe Chill was our choice.
We took our place on the lovely rooftop, on beautiful bean bags, had several starters, main dishes, hot nuts with our Cocktails.
The Cocktails!!! I've been working as a barman for 10 years of my live, and was really frustrated about the Cocktail Mafia on Sri Lanka. Bad alcohol, extremely expensive, etc. But Chill is different....... THE BEST COCKTAILS I HAD FOR THE LAST YEARS"
Its_Casti,"Singapore, Singapore","July 12, 2018",30,Great Settings but average food,"We were a group of 14 who came here for lunch. The cafe had enough seats with a very good layout and ambience. Visitors on the top floor where we were seated were required to remove their shoes prior to taking their seat - not sure what were they trying to convey given the guests below didn‚Äôt have to do so. We tried the traditional Srilankan ten course and eight course meals apart from fish, pizza, pasta and fried rice. The Srilankan food was not as appetising as what we had tasted elsewhere in smaller restaurants. The service though was on the ball."
Louise101010,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates","July 12, 2018",50,A good find,"Our driver took us to this restaurant and we were very glad he did! The food is superb and the restaurant is packed all the time. We tried a number of dishes because we ate there both at lunchtime and for dinner and all of it was superb. You can watch the chefs at work - and do they work at some pace - it was fascinating! The restaurant is the most popular and so patience is needed at times with the service, but you are on holiday - relax! There is no rush. What I also liked was that our driver got his dinner for free for taking us - what a lovely arrangement. If you are in Ella, drop by here and try the food - drinks are great too."
ALittleRobynToldMe,"Invercargill, New Zealand","July 12, 2018",30,Well We Weren't Expecting That,"It's a cafe that ticked the boxes for it's reputation.  The ambiance is really relaxed.  It's a great menu.  And the staff are friendly when they get around to being attentive.  We're here to chill out though and there is plenty to soak up and watch while you wait.

Even the staff member (male) who had his brand new baby brought in to show off to his co-workers.  All these men crowding around the new Dad with his new baby while the chefs worked in the background - it was a beautiful sight to behold.

And then there were the ""stray"" dogs that peacefully lay at your feet out of the heat of the sun under fans uninterested in you or your food - they were there simply chilling.

There were the massive drinks that came out that looked so interesting that you couldn't resist saying ""yeah sure - I'll try one of those"".  And food items wrapped interestingly in massive leaves that also led to a ""yeah sure - I'll try one of those"".  Both of those decisions made by one family member may have led to the reason why that family member had an incredibly upset stomach for the next few days.  In the words of resilience ""s**t happens"".

What we also weren't expecting was the dog that lay by our table our entire meal to miraculously turn up between my daughters legs in the neighbouring alleyway 10 minutes after leaving the restaurant.  We had left the cafe, walked a little way down the street when she suddenly felt very ill.  We turned to head for home, but it was right beside the cafe that she was overcome with the need to vomit up her spag bog.  So as she had one hand on the wall while she was wretching, the other hand holding her hair back - the dog from the restaurant had somehow appeared between her legs and was proceeding to eat what she putting on the ground.  The shame of it all was soon to be cleared up by the chilled out dog from this cafe.

As lovely as the ambiance and the staff were we just couldn't eat there again.  "

This restaurant is popular with backpackers, and was very suitable for families. We visited twice - both times for lunch. In the evening it was incredibly popular - seemingly impossible to get a table. I do not know if they take bookings. They serve the most popular Sri Lankan options, as well as pasta, burgers, internationally inspired fish (eg English-style fish, Greek-style fish etc), salads. Everything we tried was delicious. The stand-out features were the relaxed vibe and fantastic layout. Try the 'no shoes' rooftop zone."

Fabian J, ,"June 17, 2018",40,Good pizza and good drinks,"I wouldn‚Äôt go here for an authentic Sri Lankan dining experience, but as me and my girlfriend wanted western food this was perfect. We both had pizza, Topicana and the vegetarian one (we both agreed the latter was the better choice) although both were delicious.The food held western standards and the drinks (we both had the Ella Mule) were very good. Recommended!"

Unfortunately it is almost too busy.
The service is not great, the waiters take their time and are not very friendly.
The food we found below average, we've had sooo much better.
Looks cool, is nice for chilling and drinking cocktails, but i would not go again for dinner."
YingKaiO1, ,"June 14, 2018",30,Indeed very vibey,"Great atmosphere and indeed very chill here. Not the typical Sri Lankan eateries you get and it's very 'Balinese' style. I came here with high expectation but I wasn't so impressed with the much raved about Lamprais. The rice wasn't fragrant enough and the dish seems to be simply mixed vegetable rice wrapped in leaves. But yeah, if you want to see where backpackers gather, here's the place in Ella."
jonoutandabout,"Greater London, United Kingdom","June 14, 2018",40,Very good food here,Crammed with backpackers of all sorts. This place is a great meeting point. The food was also very tasty. I had their signature lump rice. I would recommend this to visitors or the region

FamilyStephenson,"Bracknell, United Kingdom","June 14, 2018",50,You‚Äôre never too old,"We ate here for the two nights we were in Ella and it was hard to fault. Despite the fact we were twice as old as almost everyone there, particularly those on the very backpacker centric top floor, we were made to feel very welcome. The service (particularly from our friendly waiter Upul on the second night) was fast, efficient and friendly. Food is very good and priced for the cash strapped traveller. Seems hardly worth reviewing based on the other 4,000+ reviews, but Upul deserved a mention!"

While I usually tend to avoid places like this, I'm happy I ate here (multipe times). It's a comfortable chill place with good western style dishes and also very good local cuisine. We went there as a family with a 4 year old kid; and the waiters were always joking around with him. Once he fell asleep on the table, and a waiter brought him a small mattress and we could let him sleep on the floor. I think the waiters name was Amila; he did an overall good job."

But this time food wasn't so great as the first time, but still it was ok. Staff is very efficient and friendly. However, only drawback is they allow people to smoke. There was a couple and they were smoking continuously after their meal ( I guess) and we all felt really uncomfortable. We had to be passive smokers. It was a very unpleasant and unhealthy experience. Its better if they could separate an area for smokers."
juliawA2189EW,"Kingsford, Australia","May 25, 2018",30,Good for western food and coffee,We were happy to get a good coffee here but ultimately it‚Äôs very touristy and quite expensive. We opted for Sri Lankan food where possible so not really my thing. Ultimately can‚Äôt fault it.

rachaelh781,"London, United Kingdom","May 17, 2018",50,"Fun, friendly and great food!","We shamefully ate here four evenings in a row! It just had the best atmosphere and the food was great.

You can eat out the front and watch passers by, or there‚Äôs a more fancy area at the back, plus a really cool roof top bar which is definitely worth a visit.

We ate the Lamprais (rice and curry cooked in banana leaf) which they are well known for. Plus burgers, snitzel, and spaghetti - each time I thought it wouldn‚Äôt be as good as home, but each time we were really impressed and left very happy. You can actually see the chefs cooking at the back and they obviously take it really seriously and are very professional.

They also had a really good range of cocktails and some beer.

Thanks so much for a great time!"
LucyS229,"Bedford Park, Australia","May 17, 2018",20,Food is expensive and not great,"We went for a drink when it was raining and decided to have dinner. Firstly they did not give us the wine on the menu and being South Australian, we knew the wine we had was the cheapest quality and we paid $2700 rupees. The food was also not cheap and they offer western dishes of poor quality. It is a nice place upstairs to hang out on the beanbags, but be wary of your choices."
MCCRLJS,"Sydney, Australia","May 17, 2018",40,Solid dinner,This place is catered to travellers so the prices reflect that but if you‚Äôre after a solid western meal then this is your place. Burger was big & juicy and the curry was pretty good too.

But if you've been in Sri Lanka and want something normal to you, GO HERE! They have pizza and pasta and ice cream. We went to Ella about halfway through a ten day trip and this place was perfect in between all the curried meals we had. Staff was great, it was clean, wifi, it was very nice. Food was good, portions were good. It was a little more expensive than other Sri Lankan restaurants around, but we only went to more authentic food places, so I'm not sure how this compares with other Americanized places price wise. But It was very nice. Would go back again."
TamalaTamala,"Zurich, Switzerland","May 16, 2018",50,Perfect place for sad weather,"We loved this place. With 3 different sections it was perfect for all occasions - dinner, lunch, coffee, chilling (there is a lounge at the top). It's a perfect little gem for when the weather gets sad.

Andreakaren, ,"May 14, 2018",50,Lovely relaxed vibe and great staff,"Called in here for lunch today as there were quite a few people already in which we took as a good sign!

We loved it . It has a very relaxed atmosphere, good chill out music playing and a menu to suit most international tastes. The food was piping hot (actually pretty unusual for Sri Lanka where tepid food is normal). Really big portions but we ate it all because it was so delicious.

The staff are lovely, very friendly and helpful, going above and beyond the call of duty. While we were there one of the guys helped a Dutch tourist who had received a leech bite on his foot.

If we come back to Ella again and there are lots of reasons to visit this stunning place this restaurant will be our first port of call."

We were given the choice of which floor we preferred to sit on, they were all very busy! We ventured to the top floor as there was more of an atmosphere. We were sat round a table with bin bags, it was a little close but it wasn't a problem.
I was so so happy to finally see a menu that included burger and chips! It did not disappoint nor did the price of the beer. I would definitely recommend this place if your looking for more of a home comfort food. Also one of the few places not to charge service charge.
The only draw backs were that we had to remove our shoes at the top of stairs, usually not a problem bu one of my friends had her taken. Also breakfast was advertised and we did venture there in the morning but they were surprisingly shut."
ayesha c,"Manchester, United Kingdom","May 8, 2018",40,Best fresh juice ever !,Came here for dinner one evening - food was good and I‚Äôm glad to have had a break from rice and curry. But for me the best thing was my juice - it was made fresh and so cheap! One of the best fresh juices I‚Äôve had in a long time- try the mango/passion fruit/pineapple mix. Service was fast and the staff friendly. It‚Äôs probably the busiest place on the Ella strip and I can see why. Great place to hang out for a meal and drinks.

Dinner was in the heart of the restaurant right near the chefs.... it can get really busy so go early- but the staff was super attentive and the food was really good.... fish and chips was superb, fresh juices, burgers, Greek grilled fish... all excellent.

Lunch we ate upstairs - relaxed atmosphere with beanbags, low tables and chill music.

Good food, decent prices, super atmosphere... best in Ella.. if you find yourself in Ella- it‚Äôs worth it to stop by Chill"

CatalystGopro,"Colombo, Sri Lanka","April 28, 2018",40,Ambience is worth it,"Walking along the main road Cafe chill stands out as it has a tree house structure . We walked into a shoe free lounge area which was crowded and 15 minutes later we got a table . Food took around 15 minutes to arrive and it was quite pleasant. The fish and chips consisted of two beautiful beer battered chunks of fish with a well dressed salad. We also got the chicken schnitzel ,veg burger and then chicken rice and curry, All of which stuffed us to our hearts content . You can expect an average of around 1000/- lkr per head here

Will definitely visit again."

Mohammed Vidal who served us was so good and was happy to serve. Nothing was too much trouble for him. Leave 2 hours for your drinks and dinner. You will not want to leave before. .

The place is huge, with 3 stories, first 2 more focused on eating and the third one is more a chill-out zone perfect for having some beers; you can eat here too.

The prices are more than fine and the food was tasty. However, the following day of eating here both my wife and me had some stomachache...not sure if it was due to the food here or not...

A highly recommend this place in Ella!"

Wayne1953,"Sydney, Australia","April 23, 2018",50,This is a must!,"As travellers we all have so many choices of restaurants to choose from so make life easy and start with Cafe Chill in Ella. Our driver, Prasanna, from Fantasy Lanka Tours, recommended it to us and it was simply a brilliant experience. Our waiter Upul was so welcoming and helpful from the minute we sat down urging us to try all the accompaniments our meal came with in the traditional way to maximise the flavour. The Lamprais was the most delicious authentic food we have had so far on our trip.
Decor is superb, the beautifully clean kitchen is on view so you can enjoy watching one of the seven chefs prepare your food and the menu is extensive catering to multiple cuisines from around the world. We hope to return to this fabulous restaurant in the future.

Once you arrive you take off your shoes and plonk yourself into a bean bag or table. My partner and I were so relaxed the whole time thanks to our awesome waiter Yoga every night. They remembered our drink order from the first night without even having to tell them. They definitely deserve a tip at the end.

Delicious pizzas. The ella mule cocktail is amazing too (coming from a cocktail snob) with decent quality cardamon infused vodka!"

Wayne D, ,"April 8, 2018",30,Not so chill,"My partner and I stopped here for a drink initially, and then decided to have dinner. We almost didn‚Äôt stay for dinner due to the attitude of one of the waiters, who was trying to take our drinks before they were finished and who also told me that 5 minutes was too long to wait to order my next drink (my partner was still finishing hers) because the place was ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù, implying that there were waiting customers who would spend more (even though there were empty tables).

We ended up staying for dinner and the next waiter was much better. The food itself was ok but definitely not anywhere near the best we‚Äôve had. Having had a lot of great and really flavoursome meals in Sri Lanka so far I found the Lumprais a bit lacking. My partner had he chilli pizza, which again, was ok but not amazing. The devilled cashew nuts were a good starter."

ADTripper1,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","April 7, 2018",40,Top End Backpackers' Haunt,"Cafe Chill is the biggest and busiest bar and restaurant in the backpackers' hub of Ella. It's quite pricey by Sri Lankan standards but not by those of the mostly western clientele, so it was full (on a Tuesday) and buzzing. The menu is quite extensive but we fancied a change from Sri Lankan curries so had western food - fish and chips; pasta and a couple of veggie burgers, all of which were pretty good (and decent portion sizes), and a couple of bottles of Lion beer, Coke etc. Service was surprisingly good for such a large (three floors) and busy place and we left feeling that we'd had a good evening.

First of all the service was quite poor on the night we dined here. We had to ask three different members of staff to take our order: first one made eye contact then quickly looked away and pretended he didn‚Äôt see us, second one waved us away indicating he was busy (he walked off to chat with another staff member and they both hovered around a tray of coke for about 5 mins), finally had to ask the host to find us someone to take our order.

My burger was very average so I don‚Äôt think this place is known for its food either...so I‚Äôm quite confused about why it‚Äôs so popular."

Drinks and food were of average price (not cheap or expensive)."

danlee7, ,"April 3, 2018",20,Very overrated,"We came here expecting a good meal and friendly service based on the high rating in TripAdvisor but we were wrong.

We sat on the third floor and service was non-existent even after waving our arms in front of waiters walking past.

For food we had a beef burger and club sandwich. Both were pretty terrible. My club sandwich was 5 slices of bread with some filling - I reckon a ratio of 70% bread and 30% filling. The coleslaw it came with was inedible because it was so heavily salted.

It obviously does well because of the cool vibe, decor, and reasonably priced drinks, but I don‚Äôt understand how the other reviewers thought the food or service were any good."

They have loads of seating front and back, the place always looks busy and the visitors looks happy with what there eating.

They have a nice selection of drinks that hit the spot, the milkshake is good if that's your sort of thing!

I do like the little table buttons, allowing you to ask for service and ask for the bill without having to staff waving someone down, nice touch - more places should have this!"

Wouldn't go here again"
marthelillis,"Stavanger, Norway","March 30, 2018",50,Favourite place in Ella!,We were only staying in Ella for two nights and decided to eat dinner her both nights. The third floor has such a cool atmosphere with the furniture and good music. Food is excellent and the drinks are even better!
Daniel M, ,"March 30, 2018",40,Very chilled as the name depicts,This a pretty cool place we had lunch here and the food was delicious also the place comes to life at night. The Cafe had fire braziers outside with different floors and replicated the styling of a beach hut. It was cozy with bean bags and carved wood tables. Would definitely recommend checking this place out especially in the evenings

daniellecJ9760YZ,"Belfast, United Kingdom","March 29, 2018",40,Highly recommend,"Got recommended this place by a friend and our host in Ella. We arrived around 8.30 and it was packed full. We had to que to get a table (only a few minutes tho) everything looked so good as we waited to be served. The menu had a great choice of curries, pizzas, pastas, omelettes, burgers and dishes from around the world.

Having just done Adam‚Äôs peak and sat on a broken down train from Hatton to Ella for a couple hours- I was ready to indulge. I went for a pizza with chicken, ham and garlic- it was good size and really tasty! My boyfriend got a 10 type of curry dish which came in a banana leaf- it also looked fab!

We decided to go again on our last night as my boyfriend fancied something western. He got a chicken burger (they seem popular and he liked it) however he preferred mines which was a chicken baguette as was filled with good quality chicken! We didn‚Äôt even realise there is an upstairs loft which is a cool bar and seating lounge with large cushions on the ground- the music is good and it‚Äôs busy with travellers.

Cocktails start from like 570rs
Beer 380rs
Cider 670rs

This place is pricy by Sri Lanka standards. 4900rs for 2 mains, 4 drinks first night and 4300rs the second time!"

newnhamites,"Newnham, United Kingdom","March 28, 2018",40,Popular venue,"Chill Bar is on Ella‚Äôs busy Main Street. It seems to be the go-to place for the majority of visitors to the town, which means it‚Äôs busy whatever time of day you go there (the many Western menu options undoubtedly a draw for those seeking a change from curry). We ate there twice, partly because a major power failure had resulted in the closure of a number of smaller restaurants and bars that didn‚Äôt have generators. The first night we shared a pizza, which was good. The second night my husband had the lump curry, which he said was tasty. My veg stir fry, however, was pretty bland.
We also popped in one afternoon after climbing Ella Rock and enjoyed a couple of chilled lassis and beers on the relaxing top floor."

Tashasmith94,"Oxford, United Kingdom","March 27, 2018",30,Slightly underwhelming,"This place was always absolutely rammed so they must be doing something right but our visit was slightly underwhelming. Maybe because it was too busy for them to cope?

Food was ok, nothing special, and obviously took a while to come because of how busy it was. Staff were OK but overworked and one of orders was slightly messed up, that happens and it's fine but the way the staff dealt with it wasn't great considering was their fault.

Had some nice cocktails but slightly expensive and the passion fruit mojito just had way to much mint in that I could take a sip without having a whole mint plant in my mouth.

Maybe would be bit better when quiet, but that didn't seem to be ever."

After eating local cuisine for more than a week I was happy to see the large variety of options Chill served up. I got the mushroom burger (one of the best meals during my two week stay) & my partner got curry wrapped in a banana leaf (he says it was one hottest curries & tastiest meals he had) it wasn‚Äôt cheap but then again I know it also wasn‚Äôt the most expensive meal we‚Äôve had and to be honest it was worth every cent."

lovingfloyd,"Washington DC, District of Columbia","March 22, 2018",30,"Big, crowded restaurant in centre of Ella Town","Many people will point you to Chill for food. I can see why given the menu with many familiar Western food items, but it's just a big, crowded restaurant and frankly felt totally chaotic. It's convenient and has space if you've got a group or kids, but plan to wait for a table if you go during peak times, and it's relatively expensive.

Also, they have TVs for sports, etc., but when we asked to watch the Six Nations Rugby final between Ireland and England, they were so busy that not one of the staff members we asked would even try to find the channel. Just felt super impersonal."
emmaw485,"Melbourne, Australia","March 21, 2018",40,100% Chill vibes,"Great cafe/ bar on the main road. Three floors available for R&R after the long drive or train ride to Ella. Extensive menu of western, Chinese and Sri Lankan food. A bonus is that there are a few different options if your gluten free.

One downside is that it‚Äôs packed by 6-7pm so hard to get a seat. Upside is that it‚Äôs full with fellow travellers, so lots of people to share travel tips and ideas with about areas to explore whilst your in Sri Lanka.

Note: you will need to take your shoes off if your sitting on level three so keep this in mind when needing to use the bathrooms. The floors can be wet from some inconsiderate patrons washing their feet with the toilet hose."

davidhogsholt,"Shanghai, China","March 18, 2018",30,"Crowded, 99% touristy, food bland = way over hyped","If you need a break from local food, need a fix of western food and chill music and don't mind three floors chuck full of fellow tourists then it could have been a cool place. But it's not. The food is simply average, substandard meat in the burger (the mixed in herbs does an ok job at camouflaging that fact) and extremely bland stir fried chicken. For the latter we asked if they could add some chili. They didn't and then we asked for some hot sauce or chilies which then never arrived which leads me to the final point: our waiter was either on his first week there, still getting used to the job or just too stressed. Every response from him was pretty much either just a yes or a no.

It's truly not worthy of the hype."

Strongly recommend trying their Beef Burger, Lamprais and their signature Mojito. The restaurant was packed on both nights when we were there so we do suggest getting there early to get seats.

It's not priced like the regular Sri Lankan eateries but it's worth a visit."

If western food is what your looking for then great, but be ready to pay western prices for very average food.
The younger backpackers seemed to enjoy it, perhaps because it is one of the only places we have been in Sri Lanka selling alcohol with dinner. The town is very much designed for the party backpacker or for those who enjoy a bit more western comforts- a bit like Krabi, Thailand -and a lot less like anywhere else we have been so far in Lanka (Colombo, Kandy, Hatton, Kitulgala, Nuwara-Eliya)"

My 'seafood soup' had chicken in it (none of the ingredients resembled sea food)? My 'garlic bread' was a slice of processed plain, white bread and my boyfriends burger tasted like chewing a sock. We complained and they didn't do anything. Being one of the most expensive restaurants in Ella you'd expect the food quality to be higher. I was so shocked to see so many people eating in here...such a shame, when there's much better tasting food on offer in the other surrounding cheaper, restaurants. Who goes to Sri Lanka to eat pizza every night!

The service was ok. 100% avoid unless your going for a drink."

Mostly western food (their pizza is really good!), good snack/sharing options, and two great curry options as well. Would like to see more vegan options on the menu, but they are happy to accommodate and you can get a decent selection all the same.

ab63542,"London, United Kingdom","March 9, 2018",10,Disappointing meal,"We thought we would try Cafe Chill on our last night in Ella as we had heard many great reviews about it and even our guide recommended it to us. The place was buzzing when we arrived and the atmosphere seemed very lively. However, it was one of the worst restaurants we've ever been to. The service was awful; the waiters placed us in a corner table and no one came to take our order for nearly 45 minutes until we had to go find someone ourselves. We then tried to order the Lamprias curry (the most popular dish) only to find out it had sold out earlier as did other items of the menu we wished to order. We had to wait another half an hour for our food which was all cold when it arrived and as well as that, one of the vegetarian meals we ordered came with chicken. The staff didn't seem to care at all when we told them. Overall, it was a very disappointing meal and a horrible way to end our stay in Ella. I wouldn't recommend Cafe Chill to anyone."

Their curry is good, their fruit juices and lassies are good. Sometimes it looks full but don‚Äòt be fooled - there‚Äòs a huge back room and a second chillout floor. During rush hour it actually is quite full, so you might have to wait a bit for being served."

Good variety on menu - Pizzas are fantastic ( lovely crispy thin base). We had 4 different starters , 4 different mains and not one disappointment.
Warning- there is an open drain at the back of this property and gives off enough of a smell in late evening - enough to make us relocate towards the centre of the restaurant."
david g,"Tring, United Kingdom","March 2, 2018",50,great evening meal in busy restaurant,Arrived 6.30ish and got a table for two but it was already very busy. Waiter was very efficient and staff were all very friendly. Good choice of meals and drinks. Thoroughly recommend the devilled chicken if you like hot food and the rice and curry of the day was great value too. Meant we have more money to spend on excellent cocktails. Passionfruit mojitos and ella mules recommended. This place is good value and very popular for families and solo diners. Very happy to recommend
Damadelmaiz,"Cape Town Central, South Africa","March 2, 2018",50,Best service in Sri Lanka!,"I came here with friends for a drink on the top floor and the entire place was packed to the brim, really buzzing. Our bartenders however, never lost track of us, and we got our drinks quickly.

The next day I came back for lunch (7 curries - incredible!) and was given extra eggplant curry because I love it.
They used to give cooking classes but no longer do, so I asked about the recipe. My waiter took me to meet the chef (shout out to Nadiga) who personally recited his recipe to me!

The food is excellent and the drinks menu, imaginative. The top floor space too, is gorgeous."
Cristina B, ,"March 1, 2018",50,Really chilled/ A reason to come back to Ella,"Go upstairs (last floor)!! Really good atmosphere, music, service and fast central bar. Cocktails were very good and alcoholic ;), try Pina Colada and Black Gin Tonic!

660nicolas,"London, Ohio","February 28, 2018",40,Slightly expensive but nice spot,We sat here one afternoon to read a book and drink some beer. Had a few poppadum snacks and a pizza which was fine. It was a little more expensive than a classic Sri Lankan place but that‚Äôs what you get when you chose a tourist place! Very nice spot to relax for an afternoon in the shade. Great bean bags etc if you want to sit on the floor.
Florence O, ,"February 28, 2018",50,Fun bar to relax,"Just as the place suggests, it is a great place to chill. The top bar is awesome with a range of seating including bean bags. The staff are friendly and attentive. And the music was excellent."

MrMink,"Sydney, Australia","February 26, 2018",40,a busy rocking place with good food,"This place has apparently just grown and expanded thru the current site. I ordered a lamprais, a rice and curry dish steamed in a banana leaf. Although there was a vego option just went with the standard, and somewhat surprised to find two largish chunks of chicken in it - to more Western tastes no doubt, as all the local food I have had in last week in SL has been mostly vego and none the worse for it. Food spicy in a nice way but not chilli hot. The atmosphere is fairly chill in terms of the style music, but at least it is not trying to be a nightclub. Seems a fairly universal option for anything - just to eat, or just to drink etc. Service was good for such a busy place. Would certainly go again."
588sedab,"Ankara, Turkey","February 26, 2018",10,Disappointed!,It is funny that how Waitresses are cocky. I heard them being very rude a customer. Food and coffee is just ok. Nothing very special. Ella is full with western restaurant. You have better options don‚Äôt go there!

ovelaur,"Bergen, Norway","February 25, 2018",30,Average food,"We had local specialities, and most other places in Sri Lanka we had local cuisine it was better. Seems to be very popular with tourists, and I guess that is due to its selection of western food (we did not try)."
Jonathan W, ,"February 25, 2018",10,Worst food in Sri Lanka,"Cafe Chill honestly had the worst and most egregiously overpriced food we had in all of Sri Lanka after 2 weeks of traveling. We only ate a couple of bites of our meals. We also had 2 cocktails that were pretty awful. It's sad because overall the food in Sri Lanka is really good. You'll not see a single Sri Lankan getting close to eating here.

The place is packed all the time with Europeans and in all fairness if you have been traveling for a while and just want a beer in a western fusion style place Cafe Chill might do the trick.

Just don't think this place is part of Sri Lankan food or vibe."
roxanne g,"Hanoi, Vietnam","February 25, 2018",10,"Rude service, racist and aggressive waiter","I visited this place in December and had a terrible experience.

My boyfriend and I ordered 3 dishes, but the moment after we ordered, we realized that we forgot the wallet at the hotel and could only afford 2 dishes with the cash we had, so we had to cancel 1. We talked to the waiter just 2mn after ordering, he replied that it was impossible because the software didn't allow cancelling an item. I asked for a manager to help us because he was obviously not trying hard, but he said there is no manager there. He was talking in a very rude way, and insisting that we should go to our hotel to take our wallet and come back, even though it would take 30mn.

After his refusal to change the order, we decided to leave. My boyfriend was outside when the waiter came back and told me to ""f*uck off"" in a very aggressive way. The guy started shouting at me and abusing me. My boyfriend came back and the waiter started picking a fight by shouting that he should not come there and act as a tourist if he had no money to spend (my boyfriend is from India and this comment was clearly racist).

A few seconds later, we were in the middle of the street and 2 other waiters were standing there, watching with their arms crossed, while the waiter was threatening to beat up and kill my boyfriend. I was trying to separate them and calm things down, and i got pretty scared that he would beat us both as he was pushing us and was clearly up for a fight.

No need to add that this experience left a very bitter taste, as it was not only the consequence of one waiter being rude, but of the fact that none of his colleagues stepped in. The whole staff had no problem with this guy insulting us, being racist and threatening to kill my boyfriend. Unbelievable."
SydneySuz,"Sydney, Australia","February 25, 2018",50,Stand out service & food,"This cafe is over run with westerners but for good reason. The food is delicious and well presented, the service is exemplary and used ‚Äòhigh tech‚Äô buzzer system at your table to indicate that you are ready to order and also when you want your bill. It costs a bit more than other places but is not over the top. We visited once for a late lunch and on another day for dinner and the attention to detail was far above any I‚Äôve seen in Sri Lanka. While all the staff were very good, a young man called Vidal, who seemed to manage the front room (he‚Äôs the second senior attendant), was extraordinary. His efficient, careful attention and very friendly manner was much higher than I‚Äôve witnessed in many expensive western restaurants in Europe or other countries."
philipj865,"West Sussex, United Kingdom","February 25, 2018",40,Popular with visitors,"Busy bar/restaurant on 3 levels with a busy friendly vibe.

scott7174,South Australia,"February 25, 2018",20,Disappointed!,"We came last night for dinner based on the great reviews but was most disappointed. The service was terrible - the waiter barely gave us eye contact when taking our order, bringing our food or giving us our bill; one of our meals was cold (admittedly they replaced when told about it), and it was overpriced for what we experienced. Highly overrated."

Upon arrival the place was extremely busy, no staff member was willing to explain the seating process whether it was seat yourself etc. We tried seating ourselves upstairs but every table looked full so we settled for the bar.

We ordered a starter of tomato bruschetta with cheese with was pretty mediocre, two milkshakes to which one was served at room temperature, a western pasta dish, which tasted good but expected more considering the amazing reviews and the 10 different curries baked in banana leaves which was pretty tasty.

The next day we decided to give Cafe Chill another go at lunch time and we ordered the chilli pizza which was really tasty!"

The menu is the usual mix of western favourites and some great salads as well. Although most guide books say to avoid salads because of the water they are washed in, this place seemed fine. They several a fair range of alcohol and the prices were ok. Nice food, not local cuisine but a reliable no worries menu providing the perfect hassle free refuel for the home sick or travel weary adventurer."

The place is too packed, waiters don't have time for you, not even to find you a table. The music is too loud, so don't expect to have a pleasant conversation with your friends and family.

It has music, drinks and cocktails, and a food menu that caters for different types of cuisines, so therefore a good place to go at the end of the day.

We eventually ended up eating there three days in a row, always making sure we sat in the section in which Shan was serving as he was one of the main reasons for our lovely time there. Turned out he was the restaurant manager (by far one of the best I‚Äôve ever met so far).
The food here is incredibly tasty and the drinks well prepared.

Left very happy and satisfied after every visit.

Thank you Shan!"
hannahkate_3,"London, United Kingdom","February 6, 2018",50,A must in Ella,This place completely monopolises the restaurant trade in Ella.

The Lumprais in particular was incredible. Great service and food.

However we wouldn‚Äôt eat here again, the food was unbelievably average. My devilled chicken was tough as leather and I only ate it because I was starving. My husbands 10 curry medley lacked sauce and was way below standards we‚Äôve had elsewhere.

Also on the first night we visited after waiting AGES to get served they told us they had run out of beer."

Service was ok by British standards but fairly poor by Sri Lankan standards. Similar for food. I had a lovely Greek fish option but my 2 companions were rather disappointed with local curry, which was a melange of several curries. A thriving restaurant but a bit of a conveyor belt."

It‚Äôs without a doubt one of the best places to eat and hang out. It would perfect fit into one of the hippest neighborhoods of New York, Amsterdam or Berlin expect its impressive architecture of local origin. On three floors you‚Äôll find a bar, restaurant and chill out top floor under a beautiful wooden roof. Food and drinks are of the best I ever had. If you stop in Ella, this is the place you absolutely have to check out."
Lawrence M, ,"February 2, 2018",40,Pretty good,"Amazing location and really impressive three tier structure. This is definitely the most popular tourist hangout in Ella.

LouMar20,Rochester,"January 29, 2018",50,Been here every day on our Ella visit,"Happened across this place on our Sri Lanka trip and ended up going in as the vibe looked good. Thank god we did. We ended having almost all our meals here (minus our free breakfast at our hostel) because the food was amazing. Tried most things and the highlights are the daily and Lamprais curries - both absolutely delicious. Veggie burger and chicken burger both really tasty and the noodles are great too. Service has always been fabulous and the waiters are quick and very funny. Would say we‚Äôd go back, but we already have, numerous times. Vidal (the server) was great and always so busy but professional. Love it here and recommend to anyone!!"

The food is really good (we ate a lot there and everything was tasty) and the staff is very friendly (especially Gihan, a hard worker who was very kind, thank you!). The rooftop place is very nice to just chill (haha) and read a book. At night it gets really busy but they manage it well and we didn't have to wait long for our food. We recommend it!"

CorvusSplendens, ,"January 27, 2018",50,Great food,"We ended up eating here a lot. It's worth the wait for a table (which can be half an hour or more if you go at 7pm!). Both the western and Sri Lankan food is excellent.

LookFurther,"England, United Kingdom","January 25, 2018",10,Liars with bad attitude,"Did not like it here at all. It was super busy, so we thought cool, lets have a few beers and soak in the atmosphere upstairs.

We ordered 4 beers and the waiter told us (very impolitely) that they'd run out of beer... we were like surely not, but okay it's pretty busy so maybe. So we looked at the cocktail menu he gave us and they were waaay over priced. Because of this and because of the rude and arrogant attitude of the waiter, we decided to go to one of the many other bars in town for a drink (or 4). On our way out, we asked downstairs if they had any beer and the woman replied yes, of course! And very cheerily listed all their available beers, whilst pointing to them in the fridge... proving that the previous guy was lying through his teeth just to get us to buy their overpriced cocktails.

Did not appreciate the attitude and the complete transparency of the original waiters' lies."
sprecks2,"Dorking, United Kingdom","January 25, 2018",50,Very Good,"Best place to eat and drink in Ella. This place is massive and is always busy and full of mostly tourists. Head to the top floor and chill out on a Bean bag and enjoy a cocktail and chill out.

The beers are reasonably priced, the food consistently good, service comes with a smile, and the wifi is generally useable. Upstairs is a delightful barefoot oasis with beanbags sprawling over low tables at which an afternoon can easily be passed watching the world roll by. The lower levels are instead chairs and tables that always seem to be full, but worth the wait, especially if you can jag one near the open kitchen. We returned for many more meals than we intended during our stay - but definitely no regrets here!"

Toward the back of the ground floor you can watch the busy kitchen work through what must be close to 1000 covers a day.

We are the lamprais which was excellent, as are other local dishes. They also do good western food if you need a break from curry - the burgers and pizzas are decent quality.

It‚Äôs priced a bit above local prices but it‚Äôs worth it. The cocktails are good and the beers are cold. The best place to sit is on the more relaxed top floor. Take your shoes off, sit on a bean bag and enjoy the good vibes."

The waiters were very friendly (as is usual in Sri Lanka) and the food was excellent. I liked the decor and the furniture described by my sons as ""cool"".

By far the best waiter i experienced during my whole roadtrip around Sri Lanka, He gave good recommendations on the food and drinks which made us all very happy and satisfied. Tasty food and mr Rasika made the whole experiencec much better."

James D, ,"January 16, 2018",50,A not so hidden Gem!,"We visited Cafe Chill after seeing it on our walk from the train through to our Hotel & Spa. Fr Gough & I both decided that this would be the place we would frequent, due to the relaxed atmosphere and positive vibes exuding from here.

Upon arriving in the restaurant, it was clear this was a popular venue, truely packed to the rooftop! The service staff were evidently run off their feet due to the volume of customers, but still providing the highest level of service!

We were seated at the kitchen counter waiting for tables to become available. Due to the absolutely awe inspiring view of the bustling kitchen, we requested to remain here for dinner. It was a truely humbling experience watching the chef's perform in front of our very eyes, you would have sworn it was choreographed with the finesse that was displayed comparable to an F1 pit team.

The food was spectacular and cocktails divine, all with a very reasonable price tag! We would (and will before the weeks out) visit this establishment again!

It was a truly blessed experience,

Holiest Regards & Namaste,
Fr's Douglas & Gough"
Grace H, ,"January 16, 2018",50,"When they say chill, they mean it...","Can‚Äôt rate this place higher. It was a welcome break from 2 weeks of Sri Lankan food AM to PM and their western fare is actually decent - would recommend the Spag Bol and club sandwich...! The curries looked good as well though.

The three levels of seating each offer a different ambiance, and the place is always heaving (in a good way) with travellers. The best level by far is the top level - everyone goes barefoot and the vibe is definitely... chilled! In the evening they serve amazing cocktails and drinks - either sit around the large bar in the middle or down on one of the floor tables and relax!"
annagN4373DW, ,"January 15, 2018",40,Hiker‚Äôs point,"Have been there for breakfast lunch and dinner. Quick stuff, nice menu, all the travelers gather here together before or after hiking so that you can find a company for yourself or get an advice or useful tip. The food though is nothing special."
emilypE4350EY,"London, United Kingdom","January 15, 2018",30,Average Sri Lankan food,"We only ate here once. We ordered rice and curry. It wasn‚Äôt horrible, but it was our least favourite meal that we had in Sri Lanka, and it was the most expensive. We had much tastier meals in Ella for about half the price. We only ate local dishes though - if you are craving western food this is probably a good place for it."
AshishGuptasfo,"San Francisco, California","January 15, 2018",50,Good continental cuisine,"This is type of cafe that you could find anywhere in the work serving continental cuisine with pizza and burgers leading the way. We did end up eating here for both dinner and lunch as it is a big space, they are quick and have a wide selection on rhe menu."
ljwaller42,"Kent, UK","January 15, 2018",40,Food good .....very popular place,"Ella was packed with tourists when we visited in early Jan and most restaurants very busy & had to wait for a table. This is the biggest restaurant on the 'strip' and still had to wait awhile as very popular. Food was good, I had lumprais (lump) curry which comes wrapped in a banana leaf and contains rice & various curry items & accompanyments, husband had curry & rice with usual side dishes. Both tasty only complaint was quite dark in there so cant see what your eating very well!"
Minnie1238, ,"January 14, 2018",50,Very impressed,"I normally prefer the local food but equally am also very curious how local restaurants pull off food from other countries. The freshly squeezed detox smoothie was absolutely delicious and so was their tzatziki which they use for their light options and salads. I was impressed of how authentic it tasted. I rarely come across a good tzatziki as the one at Chill.

Assigning tables to people is disorganised but I was lucky enough to get a good seat on the ground floor in the end. It was a 25min wait. Others might not be so lucky but there is a chill lounge with beanbags on the top floor where you can just walk in. Great vibe and music. Expensive for Sri Lankan standards but as they pull it off so well in creating the authentic European taste and have a good and impressive menu overall, the prize tag is worth it. Would give them five stars overall."
E7836IZjohnm, ,"January 14, 2018",30,Meh,Food isn‚Äôt great but the nightlife is good. Friendly staff and awesome upstairs area for hanging and drinking.
James E,Sydney,"January 13, 2018",30,"Good food, but nothing special","We visited Chill twice - once for lunch as a couple and once for drinks in a group of 5. The food we had at lunch was nice, but expensive by local standards. Portions and taste were both good. Returned two days later with a group for some drinks in the evening. We each had 2 cocktails which were all very enjoyable.

The thing I didn't like about Chill was the feeling of being just another tourist. Unlike smaller, family run establishments in SL where you feel genuinely welcomed and looked after, at Chill you're just one of the masses.

By no means a bad experience, but much better service and welcome can be found in Ella."
NickolasC,Sydney,"January 13, 2018",40,Great Meal and drinks.,"The Chill has three levels and is very popular. Level one and two are the restaurant and level three is a very casual area having bean bags and a fab area to relax and have a snack and cocktails.We had two meals at Chill and the food was very good, reasonably priced .The service was great , very friendly staff. I would certainly recommend Chill ."
LibbyGTravel,"Lawson, Australia","January 13, 2018",50,Outstanding... the reviews were 100% spot on,"This place is just magic! Such a lovely atmosphere to relax for drinks and dinner with friends (and my 4 month old baby)... the top floor is where it‚Äôs at if there is space. Here you can choose to sit at a high table at the bar and watch the action, tables looking over the street or even lounge/bean bag it with low tables.
I can‚Äôt fault this place, the variety and quality of food and drinks was spot on and to top it off the service was just awesome... super friendly, helpful and really observant (always on the look out for if you need anything).
Thanks so much we will be back again and again!"
HayleyHay5,"London, United Kingdom","January 13, 2018",50,The best meal,"We came here for dinner one evening, it‚Äôs a very popular place. We were lucky to get seated immediately as we came fairly early. Service was great and the food delicious. It was our favourite meal of our 3 weeks in Sri Lanka - the lamprais (Sri lankan curry cooked in a banana leaf) is to die for. The upstairs area has a really nice vibe to chill with a few beers or cocktails on beanbags"
Olle L, ,"January 13, 2018",40,Good food,The food is good but it‚Äôs not the cheapest place. Good variation of different food. The place is much bigger than it appears!
Emsworth89,"London, United Kingdom","January 13, 2018",50,Great drinks and food,"Our driver told us he was going to take us to 'the best place in Ella' for lunch and brought us here - lunch was so good that we returned for dinner the next day too. It does get very busy and has queues outside on an evening but the food is superb (I especially recommend the Lamprais), and the drinks are excellent too. Very reasonable price and great service too. Also the cleanest toilets I used whilst in Sri Lanka."
JDJoel,"Brighton and Hove, United Kingdom","January 13, 2018",50,So good we went 3 times in 2 days.,"Went on trip advisor recommendations and they didn‚Äôt disappoint. The banana leaf curry was excellent, we went for the veggie option and asked for no rice... pure delicious veggie curries. Possibly the best food we had in 2 weeks of Sri Lanka.

Open kitchen, decent cheap wine, excellent service."
franciskozafra,"Madrid, Spain","January 12, 2018",50,Delicious,We went to here for our dinner according the recommendation of our host. Staff arranged huge portions of lovely food for us. The order was late ten minutes more than promised time....
Ally V,"Melbourne, Australia","January 12, 2018",30,You pay for the venue and not the food,"The best part about this place is the rooftop area with beanbags. It is a great, relaxing place to head for a drink after a long day exploring Ella. However, the food at this place is nothing special. There was a big group of us and we tried a mix of local and western cuisine and it was a bit hit and miss for the price you pay."
Jo W, ,"January 12, 2018",40,Slow service but fun to watch chefs,"Food is excellent. We had quite a wait as this place can get very busy, but we were not in a hurry and enjoyed watching the chefs."
Claud1601,"Dubbo, Australia","January 12, 2018",50,The quickest service in Sri Lanka!,"These guys can move and can cater for a large group quickly.
After 3 weeks of traveling with a big group, eating out in Sri Lanka can be very time consuming and frustrating but not at cafe chill.
The curries wrapped in banana leaf were delicious, we ate here two nights in a row because it was so good!!
One not to miss when in Ella after a day of sight seeing."
Jessxplore,"London, United Kingdom","January 12, 2018",50,Great food and Chill out spot!,"This place is always buzzing and has such a nice lounging area on the top floor.
They get so busy in the evening for food and have que's so get in early!

Burgers and Pizza are nice! And to top it off, they have great healthy green smoothies.
Not sure about the other menu items though, as my friend had the Greek fish dish and it did not turn out as great as he'd hoped.

Staff are super busy so you may have to really call out or get up for their attention.

Overall, great experience - totally recommend!"
Sneaks_06,"Buenos Aires, Argentina","January 11, 2018",30,"Good food, very busy not really chilled out place to go though","I went there twice with my wife, the first time we just had a juice each they were good. Second time my wife had noodles and I had the burger and fries which both meals were decent. Not a very chilled out place though because the place is packed full of three floors of gringoes reading lonely planet. WiFi was also not good, could have been because there were so many people there."
IdaDarcyMa,"Beijing, China","January 11, 2018",50,Cool restaurant with different types of cuisine,"It is a cool restaurant with nice wooden renovation of the whole place with two to three floors.

Swisstraveler12345, ,"January 11, 2018",50,Rooftop is gold !!,Go on the rooftop and enjoy multiple drinks and food ! Just perfect to relax and meet other tourists :) Service is slow but it is the same as everywhere in Sri Lanka...
gen336,"Montreal, Canada","January 10, 2018",40,Very good but full of tourists,"The restaurant is nice, fiod is good and staff friendly. Sometimes the wait can be long. They serve sri lankan dishes as well as pizza and burger. We had curry and pizza, both very good. The only thing is that it is full of tourists, you don‚Äôt go there for a real taste of the country ;-) but still nice to chill there!"
Ludivine0806,"Toulouse, France","January 10, 2018",50,Loved the top floor!,"We went to get a drink. We immediately went to the top floor were you have to remove your shoes. As soin as you get there you understand why it's called chill! Such a nice concept!
As you stay you can see the mist getting in the main street and into the cafe. We ended up eating there too, and really enjoyed the food!
Service was excellent and very effective.
You can understand that this place started Ella's attraction ;)"
KATALAP,"Narita, Japan","January 10, 2018",50,Great food and atmosphere western and local,We dined here for lunch. The curry and vegetarian burger were both fantastic. The staff were really friendly and the atmosphere was great. When passing by that night we saw that there was a line out the door so it may be an idea to get there early for dinner! Would absolutely recommend!
Fuliautomatix,"Bengaluru, India","January 9, 2018",50,Huge variety and good taste,"The cafe offers a lot of choices, vegetarian too, in both drinks and food. The ambience is quirky with bean bags and cane furniture on the second floor and more traditional seating on the first floor. The cuisine is a mix of Sri Lankan and international and whatever we tried tasted good. The service is a little on the slow side but they were almost full so it was to be expected."
JacqueJamieH,"Perth, Australia","January 9, 2018",50,Great atmosphere and food,"It was like a united nations of the world but an incredibly relaxed and happy vibe. There was a good array of different types of food and the drinks were amazing.

The place we stayed recommended Chill and with food, people playing cards, listening to music and hanging out it was very casual and yet cosmopolitan."
DaniRan15,"Bathurst, Australia","January 9, 2018",50,Vibrant cafe/bar with great food,"We were initially a little wary of this very busy cafe/bar - thought it might take ages to get served - but we were very pleasantly surprised.
It took about ten minutes to get seated while we waited for a table to become free but then the service was both friendly and fast. The waiters were pleasant and the food was great. I had the Sri Lankan food which was very good, but my family had pizza and burgers etc as we‚Äôd had Curry nearly every night of our trip. All the food was great!"
LittleMisClumsy, ,"January 9, 2018",50,Great pasta,"I can concur with other reviews that the pasta really is great here!

I also had home-made strawberry ice-cream, which was lovely. I‚Äôd have liked to try the coconut ice-cream, but they‚Äôd run out.

Service was slow, but as I was dining alone with time to kill I was happy to be able to linger over dinner."
RichardKPerth,"Nedlands, Australia","January 9, 2018",40,World class chill bar,"This place is very cool and clearly a popular place in Ella. It‚Äôs big, with 3 levels of bars, restaurant and lounges.

The cold food let it down a bit but they corrected quickly and brought new food that was hot. Wine selection a bit poor. Very poor actually. We ordered some Australian white wine but they had run out...and charging the same price for sub-standard South African wine that was not on the wine list felt a bit like a ‚Äòbait and switch‚Äô tactic. They did have some South African red wine that was ok, so it ended ok."
C H, ,"January 8, 2018",50,Lovely restaurant for drinks and dinner,Wonderful evening spent here. It gets busy so I‚Äôd arrive early but the food was wonderful. Can have Sri Lankan or international dishes depending on how you feel.
Henriette B,"Berlin, Germany","January 8, 2018",40,Trendy restaurant,That restaurant has a lot of varieties of food. Especially I liked the Pizza and Pasta. Cocktails are excellent and they have some nice healthy drinks. I missed the vegetarian dishes. Chill is located in the middle of Ella and you can find it easily.
699sherm,"Berlin, Berlin, Germany","January 8, 2018",30,Too crowded for my taste,"If you want a bunch of travelers and international food, in a pub style atmosphere, thats the place to go. I am sure some will enjoy it ver much. Not my thing though. However, I loved the fresh juices, the only reason i went there."
PriyamG35, ,"January 8, 2018",10,I write reviews only when its either super good or super horrible...pay attention if you want to visit this cafe,"Being a businessman I will never write anything remotely wrong about someone else's hard work and devotion unless it's some extreme situation.
So two of us went to this place on a rainy night just when we made it to Ella after 6 hours of treacherous journey. We came here immediately after checking in.
We ordered two dishes and the waiter named something like 'Nadal' (curly haired guy) took our order and no water nothing.

Immediately within a minute i realised I forgot my wallet and went upto to the waiter and told him the same and asked him to cancel the order. (P.s. Remember all this happened within like a couple of mins). Initially this guy says it's okay. So I started going out from this cafe and my gf was behind me by a couple of metres.

Then I heard loud abusive words!! When I turned around to my shock this guy was abusing my gf and said that if we can't afford why did we come to this cafe. I was stunned. When we argued he started saying he is a local and can get us killed!! He was shouting and abusing on the main road and two of his colleagues were just standing there doing nothing. We clearly realised he must be drunk and after hearted arguments we gave up and went and complained to the people nearby.
I even showed him my room keys and asked him to accompany me to our hotel. But he was in a mood to pick fight.

I am sure if I had stayed there longer that Nadal guy and his friends would have tried to pick a fight. Abusing a helpless foreigner girl for cancelling the order even before it was ordered in the kitchen for 1- 15 dollars was unimaginable.

Yes this will not happen everyday so you can go here safely and most reviews are good because of good experiences. But off chance this happens to you or your gf for no fault of yours, and some drunk waiter starts misbehaving and threatening you, then maybe the owner will take notice of that imbecile working there."
SFernando86,"Toronto, Canada","January 7, 2018",50,Awesome atmosphere!,My husband and I came here for dinner. We were offered a beer while we waited in line for this very popular place.

Carlijn v, ,"January 7, 2018",10,Overrated,"We came here for dinner, the place looks very nice, cosy and busy. There was a line outside but no one at the end to greet you. We looked for a table and got seated on a large table with other guests, all fine. After 20 minutes (without being able to order) the waiter first made hand gestures and then took the trouble to come to the table to tell us we had to leave. This table had been reserved. There was no sign on the table and his colleague sat us down there. When I asked him if he had another table for us, he said to go find one ourselves... very disrespectful and clearly they are getting lightheaded because of the crowds here. Not for me thank you"

RKHOOKER,"Sydney, Australia","January 5, 2018",40,Happening Place,"Chill unlike its name is a happening place. Very busy & very noisy also. Great menu selections & interesting decor. Ice cold beer & wine, & our German chicken schnitzel meal was superb as were the fries & gravy. Just what is needed to escape the local foods. Service was fantastic & prompt, & best of all cheap! This restaurant has a great vibe & feel atmosphere in the main street in Ella. Only concern was a dog walking around a packed restaurant & even venturing into the kitchen (see photo)."
cairnsman76,"Cairns, Australia","January 5, 2018",30,Just OK.,"Food is decent, but very slow to arrive. Our waiter was not very helpful on the day, but others looked friendly.

Suggestions:
- don‚Äôt sit near the back of the restaurant- there‚Äôs a SMELLY ditch there...!
- upstairs beanbag lounge and bar looks great for a chillout
- One couple smoking in the middle of the restaurant, (the rear section, near the open kitchen)- made it unpleasant for the rest of the diners (approx 30 people), none of whom were smoking. Others near us were also unhappy.
** Why not make this section NON-SMOKING?"
mariekel2016,"Utrecht Province, The Netherlands","January 5, 2018",50,Chill place,Thank you for your feedback. Sadly many folks adore coming to Sri Lanka so they can freely smoke. We see it everywhere. Nevertheless your input is greatly appreciated and we will do our best to take this on board.

A great atmosphere and located on the main road in Ella, it is obviously the most popular spot around because it seems to be constantly busy. This probably contributes to the slow service the most, however, unlike many restaurants around, this cafe offers both a large local menu and a large global menu (Eastern & Western). Overall quite adequate."
Jelti,"Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","January 4, 2018",10,"Terrible service, staff were rude",We knew that the wait would be longer to get a table and food but we waited though and the seafood pizza and turkey (it was Christmas!) served were tasty!

NCachada,"Brixworth, United Kingdom","January 4, 2018",50,Friendly environment,"- Dismissive responses to our polite requests or questions. Drinks took ages to arrive, as did food which was warm at best. Salad was delivered after asking about 10mins after the rest of the food.
- not a single word was spoken by the person who took my credit card at the desk after the waiter asked me to pay there. He finished off some other work with receipts then simply took my receipt and card. He did not say goodbye, thank you or utter a single word.

Go somewhere else that at least has the decency to be polite and say goodbye. Chill, you must do better!"
LisaD3024, ,"January 4, 2018",50,Great spot for lunch,Me and my partner stopped at Chill for lunch during our Sri Lanka trip! Brilliant place advised by our driver. Kind and relaxed staff with very tasty pizza! But we did prefer the cashew starters and fresh fruit juices.

Waiting staff weren't exactly helpful or friendly, we pretty much had to beg for service. I ordered fish fingers and my friend ordered chicken noodles, both very average.

Adam B,"Sydney, Australia","January 3, 2018",50,Lives up to its name,"This is the best place for eats and a beer in Ella. The owners have nailed it - The food is fabulous. The venue is larger than one would think, spread out across several levels with a veg out on the first floor (including beanbags), balcony and cosy dark corners. The kitchen is busy and clean and the service is relaxed but efficient (note - if you are in a hurry don't go to a venue called Chill!). On both occasions we dined the wonnderful Vidal was duty and the service could not have been better!"
LaurenX2018,"London, United Kingdom","January 3, 2018",10,"Awful service, rude and threatening staff.","The food was average, service was shocking. I ordered a pizza which arrived with only cheese on top (no tomato sauce). When I asked a waiter (after 10 mins of trying to get his attention!) about why it was missing, I was simply told ""this is the best pizza in Ella. If you find a better pizza, you don't have to pay"". I thought this was pretty rude, given I hadn't asked not to pay, I just wanted a normal pizza! The service in general was really bad -- they forgot to bring our starter for example so we just left it. At the end of the meal, I explained we wouldn't be paying service charge. Our waiter started shouting at me and telling me I was a ""F*ing b*tch"" and a ""stupid woman"" -- I was genuinely worried he was going to hit me. When I gave my credit card, he took the full amount including service, and shouted in my face once again that service is not optional in Sri Lanka. AVOID THIS PLACE."

brilar-cph,"Copenhagen, Denmark","December 29, 2017",40,Good food and lively ambience - also for vegetarians,"I had 2 meals here during my stay in Ella. One lunch and one dinner. On both occassions the place was extremely busy. Travelling solo hence also eating by myself I did not mind sitting at the bar for my meals. On the lunch occassion I sat on the third floor which is al fresco and was quite chilly so bring a jumper. The construction is beautiful, built with bamboo and palmleaves used for the roof. Very cool. Also no shoes allowed on the third floor. The menu card is quite extensive offering both Sri Lanken, Asian and european foods. As a vegetarian there are many good options to choose from.
Being that the place is so busy I didn‚Äôt find it to be a relaxed setting with waiters and guests running around the whole time. And the waiters are not attentative due to the constant flow of guests so a bit of patience is needed. None the less I enjoyed the food and drinks."
Mae S, ,"December 28, 2017",40,Don't come if you're in a rush!,"As per the name, a good place to chill. We sat on their bean bags for hours drinking beers or coffees.

HanSengLim,"Singapore, null, Singapore","December 27, 2017",50,Absolute Gem!,We went there two days in a row. Great place to hang out and relax over Lion beer. Pizza is great but so is the local curry rice Lumprais. We see many local guides bringing their guests. No doubt the best place in Ella. Highly recommended.
CathyN638, ,"December 27, 2017",30,Late lunch,We arrived around 2 pm for lunch. Still very busy and crowded. Staff are responding very slow and not very friendly. But the food and drink are good. Price is moderate.
AshwaniBaweja,"Chennai (Madras), India","December 26, 2017",10,Nice Cafe in Ella- Just waste of time,"No doubt it‚Äôs amazing cafe but always crowded and you need to look or occupy space yourself.

Service is very very slow, probably they are too busy ! You better carry your playing cards so that once you place order you will have minimum 45-60 mins to finish few games.

You need to have ample time for this cafe. It‚Äôs serves beer, coffee and good continental food.

So does this mean that you shouldn‚Äôt go, YES unless you just want to waste time because once you order food you are stuck and just keep waiting.

Sorry, my post doesn‚Äôt mention about quality of food because after waiting for 1 hour not left with any stamina to taste the food."
ij684,nyc,"December 26, 2017",30,I‚Äôve priced but delivers,"If you want something international and a break from curry this is a solid go to. The espresso is proper.
The cocktails are westerner priced and good. The bar upstairs is a cool chill place to drink after a long hike in bean bags. It‚Äôs a more pricey hit to your standard backpacker budget but solid if you can afford it. The Moscow mule was lovely."
577nip,"Taito, Japan","December 26, 2017",20,waited close to an hour for food..,"We sat on the top floor of this 3 storied place .. nice ambience and busy but we got there at 2:30 pm .. / well past peak lunch hour but food took forever.

We ordered 4 different juices as they were being made fresh - but sadly they weren‚Äôt even ‚Äústrained‚Äù so kids wasted 2 of them. You cannot drink pineapple juice with little pieces of stuff cooking in your mouth ..

But The Lumprias (sri lankan item - mixed food cooked inside a banana leaf) was yummy!

My conclusion - If you offer so much seating - then you should Staff up during peak holiday seasons - so your guests can be served food within a reasonable time.

Staff was very nice .. but sadly that doesn‚Äôt make up for the slow service .."

PathmilaH,Sri Lanka,"December 25, 2017",20,Too noisy,"Me and my friend visited Cafe Chill out of the curiosity as the place looked very fancy from outside. But our expectations went downhill as we stepped in.

The place was very crowded and was way too noisy. I felt like a sardine in a can and tables were placed way too close to one another which made it impossible for anyone to have a decent conversation.

As far as the food is concerned, there weren't much vegetarian options so I ordered myself a vegetarian lump rice. To my surprise they had completely misunderstood the whole lump rice concept and offered more of a rice and curry wrapped in a banana leaf like thing. The lump rice had beetroot, mallum, coconut sambol, dhal, potato, pumpkin curry and snake gourd. What in the world!!! And that was tasteless and had no spices.

But on a positive note, my friend tried a bolognese which she was extremely happy about.

I am happy with the service they offer but they really have to work on their food. Especially Asian cuisine."

MammaNessa,Zagreb,"December 25, 2017",10,Serious health hazard,"I planned to eat at Chill‚Äôs with my family today but fortunately we first took a walk down the little dirty alley which leads next to and behind the restaurant.
There‚Äôs a small sewer (canal) right behind the house, heaps of rotting, awfully smelly rubbish just lying around, total mess inside... At first I couldn‚Äôt believe that was a groundfloor of a restaurant, I though that maybe the restaurant kitchen and storage is someplace else. But then I saw a half of a raw big fish (tuna, I think) just lying there in the open on top of a dirty wall, not even on a plate, just left on the wall and it was literally covered in flies. Obviously, we decided not to go there.

Don‚Äôt be fooled by their fancy exterior, check out the ‚Äúbackstage‚Äù for yourself, it is only 20 metres away from the main road. I wouldn‚Äôt even go for drinks there (after you see it, it‚Äôs hard to believe these people respect basic hygiene standards like clean hands, clean water or clean glasses).

Pros
Service is exceptionally good by Sri Lankan standards. We were twice served by Ranjith, he made us feel very welcomed and remembered us when we came the 2nd time. His service was fast and he always noticed when we wanted to order. He also spoke well which left us with a good feeling every time, which is why we went back!
Food variety is diverse and well made.
Ambience is very relaxing, with good music.
TOILETS ARE CLEAN!

Cons

Gets packed pretty fast so best be there by 6pm for good seats."
Da-ni-el-W-a-K,"Cologne, Germany","November 24, 2017",50,Hyped but for all the right reasons,"Well, no matter where you end up looking, Cafe Chill will be listed as the place to be in Ella, at least at the moment. First of all, we only went there to relax and have some drinks, therefore I can‚Äòt rate the food.
That said, Cafe Chill is indeed a very chilled place. Beautifully built out of wood with a huge restaurant area on the lower floor and an even more beautiful bar area up on top. Up there, you will find a bar in the center with lounge area around it. You will mostly sit on beanbags at small tables but there are some tables and chairs as well if you need to work or dine at a proper table.
It gets crowded very fast once the sun settles but we always managed to find an empty spot somewhere. Drinks were good, the cappuccino was really good as a matter of fact, and the deviled cashew nuts are outstanding.
Yes, it is hyped, BUT it simply has a lovely atmosphere and other places often cannot compete. Therefore, we do highly recommend it for drinks, working or relaxing."

SiddharthB332, ,"November 24, 2017",20,Chilled out,"I could have given 4 but the reason for giving 2 is because if Samar the guy in the red sweatshirt he will spoil your mood for sure.Really bad service from him , I have travelled all over the world and never ever given a bad review .This guy trust me has a major attitude problem and should be in some other industry not the hospitality industry.
I need to add the positives as well the the beer was chilled and the other guy serving us was very helpful and polite his name was ranjith kumar.The pizza was very good but the Greek fish was average.
Hope someone in the management tells Samar to treat guests with respect and not lie to them.
Overall I would give this place 4"

Nicola R, ,"November 24, 2017",10,Shoved to the back of the bar,"So food in this place was reasonable, beer was cheap and cold. So why the 1* review? I am in my 30's and don't appear in everyday life to repel people with my looks however at 4pm in a blatantly non-crowded bar myself and my husband were shoved to the very back of an empty, dark, back area of the restaurant by our waiter, as we watched other people being shown upstairs to the roof terrace or seated in the sunny front area of the bar. So basically if you're a young traveller with the right look you're fine but if you don't fit that you'll be hidden out of site - and I suspect that if you're skin is not white you'll struggle to even get a foot in the door."

The restaurant was super full, so we waited for a bit, while drinking a few beers.

They were not very careful with the orders, and kind of hard to get their attention.

The food was good, but not amazing. Price a bit hight for Sri-Lanka standards.

Once selected food was relatively quickly placed in front of you and it did not disappoint.

We only tried the Club Sandwich and two juices (enough for two people if you don't eat too much) and all was very good.

The only con was the fries, obviously they are not the best ever, but it's something assumable.

The prices are a little bit more expensive than usual but it's normal taking into account that most of the food is not produced locally and has to be imported.

These issues were enough for us to be disappointed with our experience but the worst part was that there was not a single Sri Lankan patron at the cafe, and we heard that actually refuse to serve the locals. We are really bitter that we spent a lot of our money on this overpriced tourist establishment when we could have got local delicious dishes at a fraction of the cost at other cafes along this road.

LynseyUK55,"Stafford, United Kingdom","October 11, 2017",50,Good food and atmosphere!!!,This appears to be the busiest place in Ella. Nice atmosphere however mostly tourists in this place. After a lot of Sri Lanka food we did opt for pizza and pasta on our visit. Both were very good and a fair price. We did also go for lunch the following day I had a cheese baguette which was toasted with an onion relish it was delicious. My partner had chicken noodles which were also very tasty. With a couple of drinks each this came to about 9 pounds. More expensive then a local restaurant however cheaper then england!!!!

gowrishprabhu,"Bengaluru, India","October 9, 2017",50,Happening place. Good food.,"Caf√© Chill is likely the most happening place in the little town of Ella. They have a good menu and the food was delectable. Service is good when we had a couple of dinners at Chill.

Situated in the middle of the main Street in Ella, you cannot miss the place. The wooden fa√ßade, reflecting use of traditional resources and a similar open upper level seating area is unmistakable. Even as you approach it, you can feel the buzz and hear the pumping music.

There's parking on the roadside, though not sure if always available. This town can get busy in season.

The restaurant boasts an open kitchen and you can watch your order being cooked.

The furniture, like the fa√ßade is all wooden and solid with minimal invasion on the natural state of the cut tree. This given an overall rustic feel, but the place has a modern ambiance with contemporary pop or trance being played.

We ordered Sri Lankan and Chinese food and we were satisfied with the portions and accompaniments. They serve bottled tonic here, in case you fancy.

The service is prompt, slowed down only by a constant crowd. The place was packed each time we went there.

The prices are standard i.e. neither cheap nor expensive. As usual in many restaurants here, this place charges 10% fixed service charge."
aarthy a, ,"October 8, 2017",50,My all time favorite spot to Chill!,"Cafe chill makes Ella a hippy mountain! Love this spot for the vibes, the cocktails and friendly staffs. Prices are steep especially on alcohol compared to other places like 98 acres restaurant and Ceylon tea factory."

CalShannon,"Leeds, United Kingdom","October 6, 2017",30,Disappointing curry,"Prices higher then elsewhere but atmosphere is good. Lot of foreign people eating, no locals.

Requested vegetarian curry but it came out with a bowl of chicken. When queried the waiter just took the chicken away and said that was the only difference between chicken and vegetarian curry. No additional veggie curries and no reduced price. Still paid the same as the chicken curry."
EmmaB703,"Guilford, null, United Kingdom","October 4, 2017",50,Great food in a busy part of town,"We stayed in 98 acres hotel whilst in Ella and decided to venture out for dinner on the second night. When driving past this restaurant on the way into Ella it caught our eye. The setting is lovely and we sat on one of the front tables so we could people watch. We sat for the first hour just having a beer which was no trouble, the staff were great! We then ordered a Sri Lankan curry and fish and chips. The waiter laughed when I ordered a western food but he was really chatty and friendly. The food was delicious, if anything there was too much food! The price was great, cost around 5000 rupees with a tip for 4 beers, 2 meals and a starter! The atmosphere is very relaxed and it seems all the westerns come here for dinner! We will be back!"

Highly recommended place to visit.
444PaulV,"North Sydney, Australia","October 2, 2017",30,A fun place,"Chill is one of the best options for eating and drinking in Ella. The food can be a bit unlredictable however. We had a vegetarian rice and curry dish presented in a banana leaf which was terrific. The chicken however was as tough a leather.

Reasonable prices. Watch out if you want wine. They claim to serve Australian wine but when we checked the bottle they were actually serving a cheap South African wine which was undrinkable. Beer and cocktails are a better option here as in most of Sri Lanka."
Andyneet,"Geelong, Australia","October 1, 2017",40,Probably the best restaurant in town,Right in the heart of Ella Main Street.

robbert-s007, ,"October 1, 2017",30,Little overated but nice for lunch,"Very popular place due to tripadvisor en lonely planet, but maybe over the top.

Yes you will find lots of westerners here for good reason. Drinks are cheap and the food is well priced.

Not sure what people are comparing it too on some of the reviews. You are in Ella. It's a very small town roughly 1km in length. There are not many options for both food and drink. This is not the Ritz.

For our group it delivered every day. The open kitchen, vast chill out spaces, cool tunes and attentive staff make this place."

maria o, ,"September 29, 2017",10,Avoid,"We arrived to Ella in the evening, so we just popped into this place for dinner as we got off the train. It was the busiest one at the time, so we thought that it could not be that bad... and we were wrong. Service was quite poor, we had to draw the waiter's attention twice to order and after waiting over 15 minutes for our drinks, watching other tables being served bottles and bottles of beer, we were told that since it was a religious holiday, they could not serve alcohol. We asked why the other tables had been served beer, the waiter said that the police had just arrived so they could not serve it anymore. When the food arrived my Lampreis, which was shown on the menu as being served with a fried egg, came with a boiled egg instead (not a major issue, if it weren't the only food I do not eat). They were kind enough to offer to do it again, but only after the waiter insisted for a good 5 minutes that the one on my plate was indeed a fried egg. When I finally got the amended version, taste was ok but the texture was all wrong, especially the rice was way beyond overcooked. My husband's fried rice also looked quite unappealing, swimming in an unidentified brown sauce, and tasted of... well, nothing. So, if you're looking for a drink or two in a 100% backpacker environment, this might be the place for you, but with all the fantastic food they serve in Sri Lanka, I'd give this one a miss."

Also had fish and chips, same fish, but not marinated of course, very nice, but not in the same league as the other. Good serves, wo'nt go hungry here. The fish, we were told, was mullet ! Don't be perturbed, it came in two large, thick, moist,excellent eating chunks, no strong flavours. I've caught and eaten my own large, top rated reef fish for years in Oz and this mullet is right up there!! Washed down with a well priced (2800Rp) Oz shiraz. Finished off with the compulsory curd and syrup dessert, beautiful. They're clever here, cheapest Lion beer we've seen in a SL restaurant, 360Rp, get's the punters in.

MANDEEP G, ,"September 19, 2017",30,Great lively atmosphere- bland food,"We went here for dinner following a recommendation. It's really big and lively and full of people (tourists). The restaurant is modern and attractive inside (western style). There is a range of Sri Lankan and 'western' food (pizza, burgers etc).
We ordered Sri Lankan food but sadly it was completely bland. I assume they were gearing it for the tourists but it was not simply an issue of low chilli concentration. We had mixed dishes with multiple samples of curries which were indistinguishable from one another. They did give us 'spicy' pickle to add to the food but this didn't do much to help.
Go to 360 instead!"
427emmaf,"Port Macquarie, Australia","September 19, 2017",20,Maybe the popularity has gone to waiters head?,"Food was nice, service was a bit arrogant. We had 2 separate groups, wanted to pay for our grouo and was met with arguing waiter that said we are together. 2 separate tables though? They were quite rude. I got our own plates and cutlery and had to ask multiple times for service. When i paid they asked for tax on top, 10% surcharge i thought covered this, and then i didn't get my change until i added up the costs myself and showed them using my phone calculator what my change should be. The older man behind the till was bot very nice, they looked cranky and made me feel uncomfortable. Also continually staring at my friend and I. A smile would be nice? There was 1 waiter actually who was amazing and we tipped him but. He was cruisey and friendly and understood why we enjoyed him being our waiter. It was because if him that we went back there."

This is a typical pseudo-rustic backpacker/tourist place that you find all over the trendy spots of the world. Packed full of tourists but not one local. Full cocktail bar and international menu. Excellent service. I had been looking for naan bread all over without finding any, so I had the chilli pizza. It was pretty good - hot but not too hot with thin crust - like a Neapolitan Margherita with hot peppers. I usually prefer a local eating/drinking place when traveling, but Chill was a good break when I needed one."

If you look around and see that there is no non-foreigners, you might assume that it's because the food is gash and locals have more sense. But actually weve learned its because they refuse to serve anyone who is actually from Sri Lanka to eat here.

The sauce of the devilled chicken, a Sri Lankan dish, was not freshly made and tasted flat and like it came out of the tin. Drinks, tomato soup and pizza were ok though.

The drama started when I wanted to pay with credit card and their machine did not approve it. Instead the guy changed the battery and tried it again. Error message but never got a receipt out. I then paid cash. Going back to the table my husband received an SMS from our bank that the money was deducted. Upon requesting our cash back, they refused. We asked for the manager who was an unprofessional guy clearly stressed who was unable to deal with the situation. We ended up screaming at each other and left because they were not interested in helping us. The next day I went back and they had not even bothered to check their cc machine. I went with the cashier guy to their bank across the road to get this clarified and the transaction revoked. I am still waiting for this refund.
