I tried the mix Sri Lanka food in banana leaf, I really liked it, I especially loved and recommend ""mango chutney"". Even if it is not served with a dish you can ask for it. It goes really very good with meat. I also tried hamburger. I loved the spicy patty, it was not just meat, salt and pepper like the ones in classical burger, you should try it. Also people working here are cool and chill people. Vidal was very good to me, he is nice and helpful person."
,,,,,
kyanashyanne,"Pannipitiya, Sri Lanka",4-Sep-19,50,"Best value, best service, and great atmosphere","Cafe Chill is honestly one of the best places to have a meal if you want great value for money and excellent service quality. From the moment you step through the entrance and into the restaurant, you genuinely feel calm. The interior design is well done and makes you feel intrigued as to what's on the menu, and rightfully so! Cafe Chill is excellent if you are not sure what you'd like to eat because it ranges from international classics like: English fish and chips, Greek style fish with artisan bread, German inspired chicken schnitzel, to local cuisines, and more. If you prefer a more local palette, the lamprais is a must and is very popular too.
Furthermore, my partner and I will both agree that if there was ever an ""Employee of the Month"" award, it should definitely go to Vidal. He service was excellent, and his positive attitude was contagious. He went out of his way to ensure that our dietary requirements were met, and even recommended substitutes for those we could not handle.
The food itself was excellent and there was nothing I could honestly say that we didn't enjoy."

sithira_thinula,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",31-Aug-19,50,Out of this world,"Ella, Sri Lanka is a laid-back town in the central hills. For local travelers it is not a preferred destination. But, once you go there, you will find that the Ella tourist area is out of this world. Amid cool climes it offers a unique architecture with multi-story restaurants done using wood, coconut & palm leaves. The ambiance is so exciting. Among the restaurants, The Chill Cafe stands out. As the name implies, it is a great place for chilling. Up-stair all wooden building creates a lovely environment. You have to remove your shoes if you are going to sit upstairs and that gives you a very relaxing feeling. Food variety is amazing. Their detox drinks can't be found even in 5 star hotels. Different food have distinct tastes, the portion sizes are substantial and reasonably priced. Staff is very courteous though they are mega-busy. Real value for money. You won't regret visiting this restaurant."

Sathis d, ,23-Aug-19,10,I was cheated,We went to Cafe Chill for lunch a few days ago. I ordered a lumprijs while my two colleagues ordered sandwiches. After about twenty minutes what the waiter served me was not a lumprijs but a packet of rice and curry. When this was pointed out the waiter slipped away murmuring something. I should not have eaten what I was served. But I am not the quarreling fussy type. Since we were already late on our work I decided to have what I did not order. It was bland rice and curry with undercooked rice. The only positive element was that it was warm. They should have told me that lumprijs was not available. I would have had something else. Why did they want to cheat a customer who thought this Cafe would be trustworthy. Very bad game of money-making.

We ordered the tasting curry served with rice in banana leaf - it was dry and all mashed up like dog food. Flavour was bland and very underwhelming which is unusual as Sri Lankan food shouldn‚Äôt be that hard... we are in Sri Lanka after all! It just tasted like dry white rice with a whole lot of crap mixed through. Ended up paying the bill and left. Cocktail was nice.

- No footwear upstairs! There is an area where you take off your foot wear so it feels like you are home. Very comfortable and relaxing
- the staff (service and kitchen) are super friendly, fast
- the food is great! Burgers, pizzas, drinks, shakes... we all enjoyed the food. The flavour of the meat in the burger was exceptional! The espresso shake was amazing and the potato wedges were fantastic. All three highly recommended! Overall the menu prices are higher than typical Sri Lankan restaurants. Expect to pay closer to European, North American prices. But it‚Äôs a nice break if you are looking for more western meals - and the quality is quite good.

Things we thought were ‚Äúmeh‚Äù:
- portion sizes are a little on the smaller side. Especially the french fries. This is a minor quib and maybe something they can work on. All in all, the food was great.

They take reservations so you should book a spot upstairs with the bean bag cushions near the front looking over the street. It‚Äôs the most chill place in the restaurant!

Bottom line, this is a place worth coming, if not for the food and drinks then for the vibe and atmosphere! Our family loved it. The name says it all and it truly lives up to it."

ATB1WP,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",14-Aug-19,50,A must-do.,"We arrived early (5.15pm) in the hope of getting a table at the front. Forget it! This place is busy all day but there always seems to be a table available. We ended up upstairs, right next to the stairs, so could see everyone‚Äôs food as it came up from the kitchen. Everything looked good. We had the curry of the day and the ‚Äúlampais‚Äù (pronounced ‚Äòlump-rice‚Äô) which was fabulous...a whole heap of curries and chicken wrapped in a banana leaf and baked. Delicious. Highly recommended."

Dinesh, who took our order was super polite and helped us by conveying our instructions to the chef and we got our food just the way we wanted it. We ordered prawn curry on toast, chicken lumprais and chicken curry and rice. The taste was really good, especially the prawn curry on toast, just loved it! Smoothie can be improved for sure but wasn't that bed to compel me to cut a rating point. The coconut ice cream at the end was ! A must visit when in Ella.
But hey, be prepared for a lot of noise as the place is packed."

alwaysluckey,"Kandy, Sri Lanka",11-Aug-19,50,Wonderful,Nice place to visit while in town. This is a very popular place. It had a line out side so we went somewhere else for a little and came back got seated quickly. Up stairs is the place to be. It's a barefoot bar and they have cubbyholes for your shoes but not enough because when its packed everyone takes off their shoes and create a pile. As we were there we had some magnificent drinks at the bar. They also had beanbags near too. If your luckey you can snag one. Only thing that sucked is that the beanbags were so comfortable some people were sleeping at the later hours so maybe some staff and keep an eye out and give them a jab.

currymonster37,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom",9-Aug-19,40,Great place to hang out,"We really loved Cafe Chill and visited 4 times during our 2 day Ella stay which says something. Great upstairs, comfy beanbags to sit on and listen to the cool vibes. Excellent cocktails and the best passion fruit and mint iced tea! Our food on both occasions was good (fish sandwich, devilled chicken and burgers) however I had the stir fry chicken which was really disappointing as the rice was over cooked and there were slices of potatoes with the veg, not particularly authentic for a Asian stir fry and made it taste soft. The staff are super friendly and they take credit cards too!"

lisaluise19,"Vienna, Austria",9-Aug-19,30,"Great location, but rather touristy","The location is great and the building is impressive, however the food is rather western and a little bit expensive.

However we found the rates are higher than 360 degree restaurant and also the choice is less than 360 degree restaurant.

This is just to encourage them to serve better for the deserving traveler as these places made Ella the best location or best destination.

He was obviously very hard working, and the place was jam packed full so we were lucky to be put on a table of 6 with a couple guys from Switzerland. The red wine I had was warm and delicious, the cocktails were banging! We shared a pizza which was so so good, wish we had bought 2! We ended up having the best boozy night with these guys and moved to the upstairs bar which is beautiful and takes you away from the view of the main road. They have a late night 10pm-2am menu which is such a great idea. This is definitely a place you can lounge around for hours and have a great night in. See you tonight!"

We had a lovely meal at Cafe Chill , my wife had the burger to make a change from the traditional Sri Lankan curry and rice, she said it was very nice. When in Sri Lanka I feel you can never have too much curry and rice so
I went for the Lumprais , which is where you get your Currys cooked together wrapped in banana leaves, and I must say it was delicious . If you are staying in or near Ella Cafe Chill definitely worth a visit.

The place, the music the atmosphere.. Everything was very pleasant and actually, you could see most of the few tourista in the town gathering there for dinner.
Food was very tasty and they serve either Sri Lankam dishes and international ones so we really enjoyed to something else apart from rice&curry in the menu after 2 weeks travelling in Sri Lanka and eating in local restaurants.
Just keep in mind that as this place has Western standards so do prices so if you are ttavelling on a budget go sonewhere else."

kellykelly15, ,"June 10, 2019",30,Average,"Food was grand, nothing special... The kitchen garden was 10 times better for half the price. Was a nice busy atmosphere for a weekend night. One massive negative from the night was that the staff here in Ella rock seemed to allow a young group of travelers to get absolutely hammered and encourage them to sing the same song for 30 mins straight, was quite comical for the first 10 mins then the next 20 mins was annoying especially while ella rocks own speakers where blaring music.... The end of that story was the young group of travelers eventually got into a fight on the streets in ella with some of the locals. Which the staff from ella rock done what they could to diffuse the situation, but the damage was done a good hour beforehand feeding them drink, when they should have been politely told to leave and go to bed."

The Chicken Lumprais was delicious. So much more flavourful than any Sri Lankan curry or Kottu I've had so far.

The Sri Lankan Special cocktail wasn't bad either. Better than other cocktails I've had in Ella at bigger restaurants (the kind you'd expect to have a decent cocktail...I'm looking at you UFO).

Amazing building, all made of bamboo, and the service was great (Upul in particular made us feel really welcome) Many people have cancelled their trips to Sri Lanka since the bombings, but we have loved every minute and felt safer here than in the UK, the people are friendly and always wanting to help you."

Not only is the Sri Lankan food amazing, but the salads and pasta and desserts are also excellent. The four of us had many different meals over the two days we ate there and they were all delicious.

Budapest81,"Szazhalombatta, Hungary","May 11, 2019",40,Good pizza,"The place is rather for international food (burgers, pizza) than local. Beer is cold, pizza is good (Italian thin style). Very busy place, it's always full. The music is loud a bit. It's not a good place to just sit and think or read; there are too many people and noise for that."
Fandango11,Southampton Uk,"May 11, 2019",50,"Great bar, good food.","By the time we got to Ella we had eaten quite a lot of Sri Lankan curry so we decided to have a change. This bar is packed every night, and for good reason. First night we had fish and chips and a burger. the fish and chips was excellent, the burger pretty good. Second visit my Wife had fishfingers which were enormous and I had the spicy pizza, both of which were excellent.. Considering how busy it was the service was excellent and the beer prices very reasonable. If I had a complaint it would be that the cocktails tasted as though they had been waved near a botle of booze rather than had it poured in making them very expensive, but tasty, fruit drinks. This is very common in Sri Lanka, so it's better value to stick with the beer."
Mitcho_uk,"Leicester, United Kingdom","May 10, 2019",50,Great food and chilled out vibe,"A great place to chill out in Ella after hiking Ella Rock or Little Adams Peak. It has a good array of well priced drinks and some great food options. I would highly recommend the Lamprais (Lump Rice) or Sri Lankan Curry, Pizzas looked decent too.

gavin_r_h9,"Kandy, Sri Lanka","May 5, 2019",50,A warm atmosphere,"Cafe Chill is easily found, central to Ella town. It's a fabulous place to sit down with friends and chat over a meal. Although, it's popularity does mean that it will fill up fast close to dinner time so it may be wise to get there slightly early. As the evening grows, Cafe Chill developed a warm, cozy atmosphere with patrons voices filling the air and the occasional, well-behaved feline trotting in between the tables. The food and drinks were freshly prepared, delivered to our table fairly quickly and as spicy as one requires. Rumesh did a great job of keeping an eye on our table and making sure we had everything we needed. His knowledge of the menu was great in helping us decide just what we wanted and the resulting meal was just right.
All in all, it was an experience worth recommending in Ella."

We had a couple of cocktails ( was not my taste) then we tried the Sri Lankan ""brandy"", Arrack.

Our waiter, Vidal, was still full of energy, he was super friendly and funny.
We promised will go next day for dinner but the weather was so bad and our accommodation was very far, we skipped that.

Third day was our last day in Ella, after all the hiking and tours we decided to have a light lunch before dinner at Chill again. We shared a pizza, and honestly can say was one of the best I ate outside Europe.

Thankfully Vidal was there, we sat in his section, but he was so busy could not really chat. Vidal is a very friendly guy, speak very well English, honest and seemed full of life. If you are there look for him Hope one day we can meet again :) Thank you for your service it was a real pleasure to meet with you."
marloushaze,"Trincomalee, Sri Lanka","April 23, 2019",30,"Nice food, but busy and $$$","This was a nice restaurant that served Western food and knew what gluten free was
However it is always extremely busy and noisy with all the people. Some like this atmosphere, we didn't.
Food was ok, standard burgers or pizza or pasta. Nice for a change away from Sri Lankan curry and rice.
In terms of cost, there are far better value for money restaurants in Ella bit I guess if your choosing to go here it is because you want some Western food and you'll have to pay more for it as a result.

A few salad Options but the tuna salad comes with pasta which seems a bit silly when you want salad as a healthier choice or if your gluten free. But, portion size was good.
zucchini salad with cashew sauce (vegan option) was better than expected and good portion. The potatoes wedges are homemade and huge.

The food was pretty good. There's a god mix of local, British and Italian food to choose from. The bar menu is not extensive, but the drinks are not expensive.

The only issue is upon ordering, it took them 25 minutes or so to make the burgers, I understand it‚Äôs busy but 25 minutes felt like a long time!

Staff was courteous, lighting was dim, we were ushered to our seat at the back of the restaurant. The seats and tables were very close to each other with not much wiggle room.
We ordered a Lion beer and detox juice. Juice was nice according to my wife.
We then ordered a vegetarian pizza and beef burger. The pizza was good. The beef burger was very average to be honest.
We'd have hoped that it was a nice place to chill out but frankly it was anything but chill."

As this was a more western restaurant we opted for the schnitzel and a pizza and were very impressed at the quality and taste of the food. We also ordered a side of potatoes wedges which were amazing. The main meals were around 1000 Rupee each which was not all for most dishes and the wedges were 400.

We had the pizzas, which were ok. I was disappointed by the tuna on my Cafe Chill Spicy pizza.
Service is v good considering how busy they are. I was slightly put off by the roaming cat and dog around the tables.

Prices are 1.5 to 2x what you'd pay for their Sri Lankan dishes compared to other restaurants in Ella and to me there are loads of better Sri Lankan places to eat breakfast/lunch/dinner."

The ambient is great with chill atmospheric music and lighting with top floor definitely the best. They are mostly full at lunch and dinnertime but the place is quite big so you won't have problems finding a place to sit. We were impressed how the staff handled the crowded floor, they were always at the right place when needed. They were very kind and helpfull with our gluten free member of the party doublechecking the ingredients with the chefs. The food was delicious and, without a doubt, very fresh as is expected for a restaurant with such a large turnover. The house Seafood Spaghetti was the best I ever had, very rich in ingredients and flavor! Their Lumprais was also finger-licking delicious. Mohito and homemade Ice tea were beautifully prepared!

All the waiters are cheery, English speaking, fast, very hardworking and brilliant at really connecting with you and enjoy serving up the food ( cooked by a strong team of chefs in a fast moving open kitchen) and also wonderful fruity and alcoholic drinks. Gihan was our favourite and from Day 1 we clicked with him. He joined in with our cheeky humour and also recommended some other excellent Sri Lankan restaurants as well. However, regardless of where we ate we always returned to Chill later on to seek him out again.
Gihan not only offered great service with high energy often all day and into the night but also showed intelligence, humour, initiative and made time to recommend ideas to make our day more fun.

That said their was a french family with 2 exuberant boys who kept pounding out of their bean bags and running all over the place. With wooden floors everything tends to shake a bit which was a tad unpleasant. Nice menu but very limited choices given how much western food is listed in it. We didn't go to Sri Lanka to eat western food. We both ordered the prawn curry and I checked the heat level first - not spicy at all madam I was told. Well holy moly it packed a punch! But is was just so deliciously full of flavour that I was determined to conquer my wimpy taste buds and soldier on. The waiter was so apologetic and raced off to procure some yogurt. The vanilla probiotic yogurt was very odd but a mango lassie followed which was perfect and I finished most of it. The lassie and yogurt was complementary. The cocktails were also fabulous and I could imagine spending an afternoon here, drinking and grazing, should I be stuck in Ella for any length of time. There really isn't anything in Ella - just the end of the train line and this great cafe."
kathymE5210IR,"Calgary, Canada","March 5, 2019",30,Just ok,"During our travels in Sri Lanka, we found that if you order traditional/native dishes, you will almost always have a better experience than if you order ""western"" food. In the case of Cafe Chill, we actually found that neither was good. My fiance ordered Sri Lankan food and I had a chicken burger (I was having a hankering for fries!). They weren't very tasty and was dry and flavourless. Cafe Chill definitely had the most lively vibe of all the restaurants on the busy strip (made for tourists) so that sort of made up for the mediocre food. Our experience was not what was advertised in the Lonely Planet! Would not go unless you're looking for a lively spot and drinking establishment."

He was attentive, friendly, and gave us recommendations that were on point! We happened to be in the area the next day and just had to stop by Chill Cafe again. Nisha helped us again with our quick to-go/takeaway orders. Thanks, Nisha, for going over and beyond to help us out. Much appreciated!"

Kleinkaufm23, ,"February 28, 2019",50,Vidal is the man !!,"I visited Sri Lanka back in November 2018 alone and at first it was hard to find a place to really hang out in Ella but then I stumbled upon ‚ÄúChill‚Äù and I‚Äôve never been happier that I did. The variety of food and drinks there are awesome and the atmosphere was superb - the upstairs lounge area with bean bag chairs made it an awesome area to mingle with other passing tourists and watch the latest cricket game.
Although all of that made that place great, what really made that place awesome was the local staff. ( A few to name) Yoga & Giahn were two really great servers I had frequently and were outstanding, but the guy who really made my experience the best and is the reason I yearn to go back there again and visit was Vidal.
He knew I traveled alone and the moment I took my shoes off at the top of the stairs he welcomed me with a great smile and awesome vibes from the first day I went there, to the very last. Not only was he an extremely hard worker, but he made everyone feel so welcome, including me and I can‚Äôt wait to find myself back at Chill Cafe once more.

The espresso was good, coming from a Melbournian who is spoiled with great coffee, this is a compliment. Do not order anything with milk though if what you want is a nice caffeine hit.

Michael M,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","February 9, 2019",50,"Great meal, service and ambiance","This restaurant has it down. The place seems to always be hopping and it can accommodate families pretty well in the back of the ground floor with 3 big table options. Also, it‚Äôs a bit removed in the back so the noise of loud kids is not too disruptive. The restaurant also has a sweet upstairs area but we didn‚Äôt dare bring or tribe up there because the vibe was too ‚ÄúChill‚Äù as the name suggests and we didn‚Äôt want to disrupt.

The service is good. All the guys are hustling around, well trained and hard working staff. Orders are taken swiftly (be ready when they approach) and the drinks and food arrive timely. Good list of solid tasting cocktails with infused alcohols.

My $.02 - You could put this restaurant in any market and I think it would hold its own.

I think for Ella‚Äôs it‚Äôs a ‚Äúmust‚Äù and you can‚Äôt come here without paying the ‚ÄúChill toll‚Äù or so it seems (we actually went twice because of the ease and quality)."

alicef675,"Leeds, United Kingdom","February 8, 2019",10,Tried to rip us off,"Came here and had average service and two burgers which were ok. He brought us the wrong bill and told us he had added fried chicken by accident and would deduct it (leaving on the extra service charge). When we told him it was the wrong bill, he then brought our bill which he had also added fried chicken on and then removed the cost of the item but not the service charge.

This is clearly a con they do for everyone and has happened to us a few times in Ella. Restaurants add extra items so they can rack up the service charge and then just deduct the cost of the items. Bit of a shame.

Make sure to check to your bill in Ella!"
Durabil,"Whitehorse, Canada","February 8, 2019",50,Do not miss,"Chef Nadeeka presents a menu that not only reads deliciously but is even better when you savour the first bite.

This is also why our driver who was not very pushy at all in terms of taking us to restaurants, made a point of bringing us here.
Again, the restaurant is not bad at all, service is efficient and friendly, food is good (albeit not excellent). However for us with a small child it was too busy and a little bit too loud."

It was really busy and packed in there which means they don‚Äôt need your business anymore and probably slack in house since they make so much off of one time tourist visits. This was the most expensive and also worst tasting meal I had during my entire trip.

I normally don‚Äôt bother wasting time writing bad reviews but this place was simply terrible and I don‚Äôt want other visitors to fall for this trap! It was a waste of time, money, and stomach space!! I couldn‚Äôt had a very pleasant Sri Lankan meal but this place robbed me of that opportunity. Ella has no shortage of dining options‚Äî take your money elsewhere !!"

The place is packed on a busy tourist thoroughfare, but the meals came fast with server Rasika checking in with us and making sure we had everything we needed.

It was juicy and flavorful, served with a small mixed salad and roll. I also ordered the Classic Iced Tea, which turned out to be like an iced tea slush, served in a tall cocktail glass. It did taste like sweet tea as it melted and was cooling on this warm afternoon. Service by my waiter, whose name was Rasika, was attentive and efficient, although the place was quite busy at 3pm. I was happy with my meal and will probably return to this cafe during my stay in Ella."

After seeing a meal which included 10 curries served in a banana leaf we decided to come back for food that evening to try it. The food was tasteless and lukewarm. As some of the photos on here indicate, the dish is a jumble of curries and rice but there were not 10 different curries and it was mostly shredded beetroot and rice. This was the only disappointing meal we have had in Sri Lanka so far."
louloubells12,"Sydney, Australia","January 15, 2019",40,Good local food,"We ate here for a late lunch, looking for something more local than western. A lot of places in Ella seem to focus their menus on western food which is a shame, so we were glad to find some yummy Sri Lankan dishes here. We had the Lumprais which comes in banana leaf and was so tasty! Mains are approx 700-800 LKR, so not cheap cheap if you‚Äôre on a tight budget, but overall we liked it there.

We chose to have their specialty Sri Lankan curry presented in a banana leaf, and it was complete style over substance; looked great, tasted meh.

Waiters were very kind and hardworking. Unfortunately the food was average (we got vegetarian curry and rice plus a vegetable stir fry).

I do have to say though that our cocktails (passionfruit mojitos) were excellent.

TLaurenM,"London, United Kingdom","January 6, 2019",30,Good western food but not authentic,"We stayed in Ella for 4 days at the beginning of January. We had lunch here twice, but bypassed it for dinner every time. It‚Äôs a good place to go if you want something familiar and ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. Great Greek salad, and they have 2 traditional Sri Lankan curry dishes. My husband had decent chicken burger, although cold... and their deviled chicken was good but really just a chicken stirfry in a sweet and sour sauce. The rest is what you‚Äôd find anywhere in the world - burgers, pizzas, pasta, stirfrys etc. Their lime mint iced tea was mixed with crushed ice and was a highlight.
It‚Äôs good food but crazy busy and hard to get a table, and the service is lacking because it‚Äôs so busy. We also felt it was really ‚Äúfake‚Äù... go all the way to Ella in the middle of the Sri Lankan jungle, to sit in a huge restaurant to eat food you could have at home in the western or European world Not exactly an experience. Better places with better Sri Lankan food and atmosphere a few steps away."

How wrong I was. The bulging rable that resembled a queue at the door, spread through the whole lower part of the restaurant and up the stairs, but it was swiftly administered to by the staff, who found a table for us in 15 mins. The clientele is an eclectic mix of families, spangled and bangled middle class back packers, desperate to look the part as they shiver at the grim reality of flannel shirts and librarians jobs back home and couples. The food, comprising of a burger for Mrs J and a devilled chicken, washed down with leveral large lions, arrived promptly and was deliceous. The bill surprisingly deliceous also, very good value for money."

We ordered soups, pizzas, burger and a Sri Lankan vegetable dish. None of the dishes were great.

Given the hype and how hungry we were, this was one of the most disappointing meals during our trip."

Its great for drinks, upstairs has a great atmosphere and is also a good place to meet other people as you often end up in close proximity to your fellow diners. We also fancied a break from Sri Lankan food and really enjoyed our burgers here. Beers are great and very cold and the cocktails are also pretty good too."

It's a good change after eating Sri Lankan food for a couple of weeks. They have a selection of western and Sri Lankan dishes, if which I recommend the chicken burger and the fish and chips. If you still have room for dessert then try to find Udaya and ask him for a banana Lassi!"

The staff is friendly, efficient, and helpful. The food is great and reasonably priced. We ordered chicken Lamprais (cooked in Banana leaves) and chicken curry the first night. The second night we went for burgers. Large Lion beers were 380 rupees and the total bill both nights came in around 2,500 rupees. On a Saturday night when most restaurants seemed to have few customers, the Chill Cafe was packed. It‚Äôs a little noisy and there is sports TV in the bar. So if you want quiet, pick another place."

Kristian_Youness,"Brussels, Belgium","January 2, 2019",10,Overrated,"We had horrible food at Caf√© Chill, maybe because we ordered some western options, like fish and chips, which was made with a dark fish (tuna?) contrary to what was written on the menu.

We met some really nice people at nearby tables. Definitely worth a visit."
Terrybloodyberry, ,"January 1, 2019",10,Rude and stingy,"Loooonnggg wait and unattentive service aside, they were rude and the food was not even good.

Nothing special on the menu. Burgers, pizza, fried everything.

The chicken schnitzel we ordered was suppose to come with bacon which it did with 4 mini pieces of bacon the size of your small toe nail (look at the pic).

When we told the waiter about it, they said thats just how it is. We can order bacon for extra charge. We had to argue that it‚Äôs ridiculous that a dish that has bacon on the menu came basically no bacon. The waiter said some people dont like bacon.

What a joke! A complete rip off.
Dont go there. I looked around and none of the guests looked happy"
88UK,"Colchester, United Kingdom","January 1, 2019",40,"Busy, decent atmosphere, average food","Cafe chill stands out as you walk through the centre of Ella, it seems to always be busy and has a nice vibe to it. The music is fairly loud and the tables are quite close together so you won‚Äôt have a quiet meal/drinks if that is what you‚Äôre looking for.

It‚Äôs big and tends to look full but walk in, grab a waiters attention and if you let them know you are looking to eat they tend to find a table fairly quickly, we got one straight away last night.

The prices are higher than most places we have visited in Sri Lanka but this may be the same elsewhere in Ella. We both had the Lamprais which was tasty but didn‚Äôt seem so flavoursome or authentic as a lot of other food we have had on this trip. We also struggled to count out 10 different curries in the dish but it‚Äôs possible there were very small portions of some and larger portions of others.

Would definitely visit again for drinks and the atmosphere, tonight we will look elsewhere for food though."

There are tv‚Äôs with sport and I imagine the bar area gets a little rowdier later in the evening.

Food was excellent, the lamprais flavoursome and hearty, while the devilled chicken was tasty and a bit spicy. The bruschetta was good as well, fresh tomatoes with pesto. Shout-out to the ice coffee, which was frothy, creamy and delicious.

We were surprised how quick the service was, despite how busy the restaurant was. Food came out quickly and hot. Our waiter Upul was very friendly and attentive, making sure that our experience there was pleasant.

The service was excellent and the whole restaurant was jam packed. We really enjoyed the atmosphere of the second floor with a high ceiling of bamboo and a huge wraparound bar for those having drinks only. We highly recommend this restaurant for dinner if you're in Ella."

Unfortunately, the service was very slow, and we had to ask several times for some water and then for our bill - possibly it was due to being so busy, which was a shame because we really enjoyed our food and would otherwise highly recommend it here."

Massively crowded at dinner time and it took time getting attention at the entrance, getting a table, getting a menu, getting the food. Tables are jam packed together clearly to accommodate how popular they have become but they need more wait staff otherwise it does not make for a very ‚Äúchill‚Äù experience.

DavidFerguson44,"Windermere, United Kingdom","December 13, 2018",50,Great service,"This place crowded while every where else empty. Says something. It is crowded with a load of bums hogging the best tables.....but we had great service from Vidal. Really professional guy. Chilled music. Good food, varied menu. People smoking in cafe but so what. It's open air and it's only 10 years ago that you could smoke in any restaurant or bar anyway.
Thanks Vidal."
Can89CH, ,"December 13, 2018",40,Cool place - always people there,"DWe had some fingerfoof and they even prepare vegan iced coffee (with coconut milk). Friendly staff! We liked this place, but sometimes overcrowded."
bindi62,India,"December 13, 2018",30,Busy and efficient eatery,The waiter is smart he reels off a large order and while you wait for your food explore the cafe and it's fun furniture. The drinks are great and so are the snacks. My fish and chips were heavily batter fried. Portions are huge so order carefully.

mystery606,England,"December 11, 2018",40,"Good, busy place with a nice vibe","This place must be the envy of all other restaurants in Ella because it is always busy. Nice varied menu and the food is pretty good too. Averagely priced for the area, so value for money. Be prepared to wait a bit when really busy."
aliciahalarewich,"Tangalle, Sri Lanka","December 11, 2018",30,Ok,"We went here for dinner and got the rice and curry which said there would be a few different curries with rice. When the dish came, the rice and different curries were wrapped together in a banana leaf.

The food we had was pretty terrible especially since Mayey Hut down the street has phenomenal curries for way less money. However, the service was great and we liked the atmosphere. We saw a lot of people with burgers and pizza so we probably just picked the wrong dish."
tinkle66, ,"December 10, 2018",50,If u looking for a break from curries,Arrived in Ella by train and dropped by Chill for lunch. Pizza were the best during our 9 day Sri Lanka trip .. go to level 3 ... place is so relaxing you could stay there the whole afternoon!
kbergl, ,"December 9, 2018",40,Good atmosphere and quality food!,"We had lunch here two times during our stay in Ella, and we were very happy with the restaurant. It's a cool and busy place with good atmosphere. The restaurant is big, and was completely filled up with tourists both days we were here. Very good food and the service was effective. You get both local and western dishes here. Seemed to be the most popular restaurant in Ella centre, and I understand why. You can't to wrong here."
JaiGuruD, ,"December 9, 2018",50,Excellent,"Good service (Upul) and food (Lumprise). Really enjoyed its relaxing atmosphere. I would come back again, indeed."

Vinokrish,"Colombo, Sri Lanka","December 5, 2018",50,A Must visit in Ella,This is probably my favourite restaurant in Sri Lanka. Been here a few times over the years and they are consistently good. Went there for lunch after a tiring drive and trek and was given great service by Saman. He looked after us very well and the food was amazing. If anyone is in Ella then this is the go to place to Chill as the name suggests.
GeorgieHillier,"London, United Kingdom","December 4, 2018",50,Super chill,The name is very appropriate. Embarrassingly we went 3 times in as many days. It is very westernised so definitely not a Sri Lankan experience but it was nice to have a bit of home away from home! Felt a lot like a ski lodge but everyone was very friendly and helpful
holistichelper,"Leicester, United Kingdom","December 4, 2018",50,Loved this place but so did everyone else!,Loved the upper deck and the bean bags but very hard to get a place. If you can you will love it! Decent Wi-Fi and prices. Always full day and night.
ellyh575, ,"December 4, 2018",40,"Nice, cool atmosphere","Loved the venue. Serving staff were excellent, I couldn‚Äôt believe how quick and efficient everyone was.

Special thanks to our waiter Lasa who was an absolute Legend."
emmap5660,"Manchester, United Kingdom","December 3, 2018",50,Something for everyone,"Good service and something for everyone. Probably the best restaurant overall in Ella for atmosphere, service, menu variety and food quality. That does mean the prices are slightly higher than those in the surrounding restaurants. Recommend sitting towards the back as we were at the front and had loads of stray dogs pestering us for scraps and just generally brushing their flea ridden bodies against our legs."
AliceTravelling2018, ,"December 3, 2018",40,Popular Spot in Ella,"This is a very popular restaurant in Ella. Nice enviroment, many tourists. Food is good as well as price. WiFi also work very good. Sri Lankan, as well as Western Options. Coffees and Juices are also good."

Jenniz99, ,"November 30, 2018",20,Dirty glasses,"We only stopped for a cocktail, which are served in jam jars but they were hexagonal and the hard to reach corners of the jar were not clean. Didn't stay for lunch based on this"
cristianofry,"Bognor Regis, United Kingdom","November 30, 2018",50,Definitely worth a visit,"Upon arrival all of the staff were super friendly and got seated immediately even though it looked full.

The inside decor is beautiful and they play really cool deep chilled sort of modern Chicago house.

The menu is very fairly priced with a massive seletion.

The juices are freshly squeezed and the food was so fresh too. The kitchen is on view in the same room which was a nice touch to see it all being made.

Overall a fantastic experience. The best meal in Sri Lanka so far."

We had an overcooked and quite greasy ""fish and chips"", a ""grilled fish filet"" where the fish was stale, dry and hard to chew and two glasses of decent fresh orange juice. Overall, a mediocre food and mediocre service. Would not repeat."
