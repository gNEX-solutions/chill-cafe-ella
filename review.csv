The vibe here is great, felt part of the young crowd again lol. A must go to when in Ella."

30,We had dinner at Chill. The atmosfere was great. We ordered seafood pizza. The pizza was nice but not a lot of seafood on the pizza itself. we had to wait a long time before we got dessert. The home made ice cream is very nice. but it should not have taken 30 minuts to serve.

50,"The vibe of the place and the food they serve were both amazing! Our waiter, Saman, was super polite and friendly. Definitely reccommened!"

30,"Nice place to sit, it quite and nice music but not Sri Lanka-like. Prices are relatively high but service is very good"
40,"Ella is a bit of a buzzing lively sort of town with lots of cafes and restaurants to choose from. Chill Cafe would be one of the best. Had an amazing Rice and Curry and then the next time a really good Greece Salad ...... whatever you fancy, they will have it. Also serve a great bottle of wine. Would move in to Excellent if they would have a non smoking area - why do people want to smoke where people are eating?"
50,Good food and cold bear in town Rumesh is very helpful. The place is full of tourists and the food is appropriate for them.
50,Great place to eat & drink. Staff are very friendly a lot of foreigners & great to meet new people! I had the fish fingers to eat & it was beautiful! Thank you to Eka for your service.
50,"Usually it is really hard to satisfy me in restaurants because most always do something wrong. This time I was finally able to get what I really wanted! The portions, the taste, the service and again the taste! Definitely a must try. The atmospher is a mix of foreigners and locals. I recommend everyone"

50,"We’ve visited here a few times over the years and they just keep outdoing themselves. Food, drinks, people and vibes are all top notch (if you’re questioning the local food this is a safe bet, but they also offer a lot of western dishes if you’re looking for something a little closer to home). PS. look for Nisha or Yoga and they will take care of you"
50,"The food and drinks are delicious and the staff is very friendly and open minded, especially Rumesh was very helpful."
50,"Great café bar with an awesome atmosphere, especially upstairs! Very relaxed vibe with great drinks and fantastic food! Was very surprised. The staff are friendly and the location of the café is central."

50,Vidal brought us the best mojitos in sri lanka ! Really great service and a nice place to sit ! You should come here ! Love it !!
50,"After being in Sri Lanka for 2 weeks I was beginning to crave a meal that wasn’t curry and rice. Cafe Chill has been the best Western food of the trip so far. The burger was great, the baguette was great & the cocktails were great! All up to western standards, no matter where you’re from. The setting makes you feel like you are really on holiday and our host, Vidal was as accommodating as could be! I am already looking forward to our lunch here again tomorrow!"
50,The restaurant is nice with a mix of Sri Lankan and European dishes and a “cool” atmosphere with lounge music. It’s not traditional but a nice change once in a while. The staff is very nice especially our waiter Rasika !
50,"We loved cafe chill! The menu is huge, and has so many options for international and Sri Lankan food. This restaurant has a good ambience and is always busy. The food was some of the best I’ve had in Sri Lanka - would definitely say it’s good for families with children aswell. Staff very friendly also."
50,Really enjoyed good western but also sri lankian food. Later in the evenings you can also catch a beer or two there. Very friendly and nice service by Rasika.
50,We came here three times during our four nights in Ella and this place was great. COol set up and good music always playing! The Beefy Burger and Chicken Baguette were our favorites and the potato wedges were also a nice side. Big bottle Lions are a must! Ranjith was our server for one of our visits and he was very funny and friendly and also very helpful when we asked a few questions about the local sights.
50,"We loved it at chill bar Ella! We came here a good number of times in our short stay, the food is amazing and such a good price, super tasty drinks and the best service as well. All the staff can’t do enough for you and maintained the relaxed vibe of chill bar. I would 100% recommend to anyone. Sampa looked after us for our last evening and made sure everything was perfect for us ❤️"
50,"This place deserves its name, it's a very relaxing place. The food is really delicious. I tried the mix Sri Lanka food in banana leaf, I really liked it, I especially loved and recommend ""mango chutney"". Even if it is not served with a dish you can ask for it. It goes really very good with meat. I also tried hamburger. I loved the spicy patty, it was not just meat, salt and pepper like the ones in classical burger, you should try it. Also people working here are cool and chill people. Vidal was very good to me, he is nice and helpful person."
50,"Cafe Chill is honestly one of the best places to have a meal if you want great value for money and excellent service quality. From the moment you step through the entrance and into the restaurant, you genuinely feel calm. The interior design is well done and makes you feel intrigued as to what's on the menu, and rightfully so! Cafe Chill is excellent if you are not sure what you'd like to eat because it ranges from international classics like: English fish and chips, Greek style fish with artisan bread, German inspired chicken schnitzel, to local cuisines, and more. If you prefer a more local palette, the lamprais is a must and is very popular too.Furthermore, my partner and I will both agree that if there was ever an ""Employee of the Month"" award, it should definitely go to Vidal. He service was excellent, and his positive attitude was contagious. He went out of his way to ensure that our dietary requirements were met, and even recommended substitutes for those we could not handle.The food itself was excellent and there was nothing I could honestly say that we didn't enjoy."
50,"Good place, yummy food and fantastic ambient. The waiter, Rasika, was very nice and helpful as well."
50,"Very chill environment, great food and great service !! Thanks Rasika for the killer breakfast we will be back during our stay :)"
50,"If you want a bit of a change from the amazing local food, then Chill is a great place to have it. Our family devoured the pizzas, burgers and salads after 7 days of local currys - and all the food was great quality, fresh and reasonably priced. Prime location on the main road in Ella, so lots going on around you; some chilled tunes; and great wait staff. Big shout out to Rasika in particular for looking after us so well. Thank you Cafe Chill!"
50,"Exquisite food, gorgeous boho decor and carefully curated music. We had excellence service from Lasa on the two times that we went. :)"
40,"Eat here twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. Food was nice, especially enjoyed the chicken burger. It's relaxing inside (as per the name). Service was a little slow first evening we went but was great second time around with Rumesh looking after us."
50,"Nice place to have a drink or two, we found it was a bit over priced but then again we had a great time whilst “chilling” out!"
50,"Great mix of international and local cuisine, very tasty food and good selection of drinks. Had meals here for about 4 times on our 4 day stay in Ella. Staff is incredible, they welcome you like friends after your first visit. Rasika, Ranyith, Vidal, Chala and Dinesh were incredible, 5 star service!!! Definitely a must visit in Ella."
50,"We were only in Ella one night, passing through and our Driver recommended this on arrival. It was just perfect. Nice cold beer and the kids got to eat something other than curry and rice. The Fish and chips was amazing!"

50,Great food (local and international) super friendly staff (especially Rasika). The place for dinner in Ella!
50,"A nice cozy place in the heart of Ella that serves some amazing food at reasonable prices. Everything on their menu tastes amazing and they also have quite a few healthy options. Ranjith, Yoga and Upul are extremely friendly and help you with customisation and also delivery food in the prompt manner. They ensure that you leave the place with a smile on your face. The food is so good that we've been there thrice during our stay and literally tried 3/4th of the things on their menu. Recommended!!"
40,"Small little cafe in Ella town. Easy to get to. Great food variety and beer. Ask for Rumesh, great service."
40,"Sampa gave us a real treat, advising us to take the Lumprais, a delicious choice! It's a busy place so don't expect quiet conversations..."
50,"We've been to Ella twice during our stay and spent most of our evenings in this bar. Great ambiance, love the pillows. Special thanks to our waiter Lasa for being so friendly and helpful :)"
50,The food was insane and Rasika was the man!! We got the lamprais and it could possibly be the best dish on the menu. Would highly recommend!
50,Good place to visit in Ella! We went for a diner and had Some drinks. Our waiter Rasika was really friendly and kind to us.

50,"In need of pizza after 8 days of delicious curry and Sri Lankan fare, we popped into Chill Cafe after multiple recommendations. The food was great, and the service quick and slick. Ranjith our server was warm and very helpful."
50,"Great food Sri Lankan and western, beers also available among other things. Prices were very reasonable- will be coming back tomorrow for some more lumprie"
50,We went there by the recommendation of the lonely planet and was really great. Nice modern place with excellent food .We tried typical Sri Lanka food and loved it.Eka advised us a fresh tea with mint and passion fruit and was sooo tasty!For sure we recommend this place !
50,"The food is simply outstanding . The combination of Sri Lanka traditional food and western food make a restaurant to explore everyday for the variety of dishes. We ordered the Lampras , that is a traditional rice curry with variety of local spices wrapped in a banana leafs . We also ate a tuna grill fish with a sweet spicy sauce , wow amazing! The best waiter is Rumesh , very attentive and positive personality . It was a pleasure eat at Cafe Chill in Ella."
50,"Decided to check the menu for breakfast thinking it would be expensive but compared to other restaurants around Ella it’s really reasonable. Great western food and the best coconut coffee! The service was great, especially Rumesh who served us. Beer prices also good so we will return in the evening!"
50,We went here for dinner and it was really great. The food was delicious and it was worth the money. The staff was really nice and friendly. We also took picture with our waiter Rumesh :)
50,"We wanted to eat something from Srilanka, Sampa recommended something special, it was perfect, delicious, and very good service. We enjoyed every moment. And because of the extraordinary service we had, we returned in the evening for dinner. Thank you Sampa."
50,"Ella, Sri Lanka is a laid-back town in the central hills. For local travelers it is not a preferred destination. But, once you go there, you will find that the Ella tourist area is out of this world. Amid cool climes it offers a unique architecture with multi-story restaurants done using wood, coconut & palm leaves. The ambiance is so exciting. Among the restaurants, The Chill Cafe stands out. As the name implies, it is a great place for chilling. Up-stair all wooden building creates a lovely environment. You have to remove your shoes if you are going to sit upstairs and that gives you a very relaxing feeling. Food variety is amazing. Their detox drinks can't be found even in 5 star hotels. Different food have distinct tastes, the portion sizes are substantial and reasonably priced. Staff is very courteous though they are mega-busy. Real value for money. You won't regret visiting this restaurant."
50,"Great place, great food and staff. Wide range of food available. The waiter we had was brilliant - big up Rasika for looking after us so well"

50,"Had all our meals at Chill, irrespective of how crowded it was and believe me, it is always crowded. From the beautifully designed decks made from Bamboo, to the modern menu which includes Sri Lankan, Fast food and even Continental cuisine. Freshly squeezed juices. It gets really busy in the night time, with most young patrons visiting the place for a drink. They probably had the best music playlist and is an excellent pace to CHILL after a long day of sight seeing. Place is child friendly."
50,"Good breakfast and lunch and affordable excellent service by Rumesh and Ranjith, Good americano black coffee!"
40,"Came for lunch and this place was busy and clearly the ‘in’ place.Very different vibe at night.There was plenty of choice on the menu, drinks and nice seating areas. Staff very friendly and reasonable prices. Food was OK but nothing to write home about - very good though."

50,"We visited cafe Chill multiple times during our stay in Ella. It's a really nice place for having dinner and drinks. The menu is extensive with both Western as Sri Lankan Food. We tried the vegetarian burger and the zucchini pasta which were both excellent. Besides that I would recommend going there at night to have some drinks (nice cocktails!) at the upper floor. We really liked the friendy staff, especially Vidal and Ruwsesh. Thank you so much for the great time and see you later!"
40,Very cozy restaurant with International and local food. A really better and professional service by our waiter Samoa in a Peace & Love ambiance. A place to go when you are in Ella.
50,After a day out of ella we had a really tasty lunch - the pizza and potato wedges really hit the spot! (we decided to have something different from the otherwise amazing Sri Lankan food so far) Excellent and friendly service by Upul too!
50,We came here a couple times when we were in Ella. The food was delicious and seems to be the most popular place on the strip.Rasika served us and was really attentive.

50,"It is the most crowded restaurant in Ella. They have good drinks, food and friendly stuff so I would recommend it from this point of view.If you are searching for a more traditional restaurant I would not recommend it as it is has more an European than local flare."
50,"This place fit perfectly in our rice-and-curry trip, we spent a super (real chill) evening with good quality western food, yummy cocktails, lounge music and young travellers from all over the world around. Lasa waiter guy was super nice!Cashew nuts is a must try for appero!"

50,"It’s a lovely restaurant with a great vibe! I had the beef burger, my boyfriend got a pizza. Now outside of the states I’m always a bit skeptical of burgers, but this one was absolutely delish! I was positively surprised. The pizza was really good too, as was my fresh blended juice and like and soda drink! It’s got a nice seating area or bean bags if you want to chill. Definitely worth a visit."
50,Got served by ekanayake (eka) amazing food and the ambiance was just perfect the name says it all sick music flowing around great experience 👍🏽😁

40,Great place to hangout and chill at Ella! The food is good and their cocktails are okay. We were served by Dinesh who was savvy with the menu and knew what to recommend. The pizzas were great and the French fries portion was totally value for money!
50,"The place in itself Is so beautiful. The structure, the roof the wood. And the food and music complete the atmosphere. But the best part are the people. With more than 300 people both our waiter Yoga and the bartender, Udaya, were super quick and really careful to all our questions. I reccomend for a moment of pure relaxation, a great drink and rest after hiking around Ella"
50,Very vibey place. Good food. Had a veg burger. Loved the ambience. Served by Rasika. Friendly staff. Was busy but service was good.

50,Went here twice for a cold drink. Great variety on the menu and got the iced coffee which was delicious. Got the chia pudding fruit bowl as well which was also fresh and tasty.
10,We went to Cafe Chill for lunch a few days ago. I ordered a lumprijs while my two colleagues ordered sandwiches. After about twenty minutes what the waiter served me was not a lumprijs but a packet of rice and curry. When this was pointed out the waiter slipped away murmuring something. I should not have eaten what I was served. But I am not the quarreling fussy type. Since we were already late on our work I decided to have what I did not order. It was bland rice and curry with undercooked rice. The only positive element was that it was warm. They should have told me that lumprijs was not available. I would have had something else. Why did they want to cheat a customer who thought this Cafe would be trustworthy. Very bad game of money-making.
50,"We tried the lamprais wich was amazing, with the perfect amount of spicy. Our waiter was very helpful and always smiling, his name was Samán."
50,Best food and service in Sri Lanka!! Great atmosphere and excelent food. The waiters are the most welcoming people. Just go!
50,We spent 3 nights in Ella and for 2 nights we went to this warm and relxing restaurant and we really appreciated the Home Made FishFingers. It was a Crisp chunks fried white Fish very chruncy served with a salad and sauces. Delicous dish very recommended to tourists. A special thank you to Sampa!
50,"Its a great place to relax and eat something after a long day of hiking and exploring the nice things in ella.The food is local food as you can also find western.My favourite thing about this restaurant was the best waiter named Sampa! He is a great and friendly guy.If you are planning to go, make sure you say hello to Sampa!"
50,"We ate at the chill cafe every dinner during our three days in Ella. They have well priced amazing food both western and Sri Lankan styles made with incredible presentation, taste, and attention to detail.Also the staff goes above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and at home.We highly recommend the place for breakfast, lunch and dinner or just as a nice hang out on a lazy day. Best place we found in town!"
50,"A special thank you to Sampa for his kindness and his welcoming. The food is very good and the cocktails delicious. Thank you ! Inès, Emily and Lyes"
40,"We had a lovely dinner here, the service was great thanks to Chanchala! Really cool vibe and definitely recommend. The home made ice cream was the highlight of our meal - so so good!"
50,"If you want to have a great breakfast, lunch, diner or just wanna hang out with a cocktail or smoothie, go to café chill! We Highly reccoment this place. The food has an extraordinary good quality and there is a very good vibe there. Our waiter was Rumesh and he was very kind and helpfull. No doubts where we gonna eat next time when we are in Ella!"
20,My pet hate is when the server doesn’t even bother to ask how the meal was! We ordered the tasting curry served with rice in banana leaf - it was dry and all mashed up like dog food. Flavour was bland and very underwhelming which is unusual as Sri Lankan food shouldn’t be that hard... we are in Sri Lanka after all! It just tasted like dry white rice with a whole lot of crap mixed through. Ended up paying the bill and left. Cocktail was nice.
50,We would like to thank Rumesh for the Good service. The Food was really good and the people Bert friendly!
50,"Ate here twice on our trip to Ella, good variety of food and both meals were great. Also some of the best service we had in Sri Lanka, shout out to Rasika!"
40,Very good food and super service by Sampa. Everything very clean and comfortable pillows on the floor - really a Chillzone. Thank you

50,We had a brilliant evening in Cafe Chill. Quality drinks and food along with a bustling yet friendly atmosphere. I thoroughly recommend.
50,"We spent 2 afternoons here, having drinks and snacks and then enjoying dinner. Staff is super friendly and helpful and food is served really quick, yet they still apologize for ‘the long wait’. Especially Dinesh and Chanhala were so kind! Would definitely recommend going here at anytime of the day."
50,"Yum!!!! Amazing food. Wide variety of food. Great prices. Staff are so incredible, they work really fast but are still lovely and make you feel so welcome."
50,"Superb atmosphere, great service, all young boys are working with a wonderful welcoming hospitality! Food and s awesome and the music is good too. Rushan gives a five star service!"
50,"A very cute place in Ella. You can find good food, perfect drinks and delightful service. We also liked the music, chill one.... we asked for it to Vidal, most gently waiter ever, and he gave us the complete list. The whole place make us think in Ubud, Bali."
50,"Had a good lunch here, Rumesh was a great waiter. Would be nice if there was some fans to help with the heat but wasn’t enough to bring down the review"
50,"Great restaurant with a vibe to match the name. We were served by Chanchala on the first night and went back the following day where we met Rumesh. Both staff members were friendly and approachable and couldn't do enough for us. Great food, choice and atmosphere. Would certainly recommend."
50,"We visited cafe Chill 3 times in 3 days :). Well decorated, good music, good service and staff is friendly and fun. Besides Chill is one of the best places to have a drink in Ella. If you like ice tea, definitely try one of their home made ice teas!"
50,"I went with my parents are my little brother, was very good served all types of food. They all had a fantastic memory I was served by Saman, he was very helpful and a great waiter! I would definitely go back there !"
50,"Great vibe, very touristy but amazing service and choice of food. Not really a Sri Lankan scene or vibe , very western"
50,"Although very busy when we sat down for dinner, we were promptly served and our order quickly delivered. I would have been happy to wait much longer as my meal was delicious! Taking a break from 15 days of Sri Lankan curries, I ordered the Greek grilled fish and salad. Elsewhere my attempts for fish were usually delivered dry and tasteless. At the Chill Cafe it was moist and tasty! The accompanying Greek salad was delicious as was the tzatziki. Couldn’t fault anything"
50,We had dinner here and the food was great. I had German chicken schnitzel and potato salad and mushroom sauce. It was delicious. My husband had a chilli pizza and he really enjoyed it. The atmosphere was great too and the whole place looks great. Our waiter Rasika was terrific.
50,"Perfect place to have a drink and a relaxed dinner. Our food and drinks came very fast, and with great service thanks to Rumesh. Rumesh also speaks a little bit Dutch 😉 ! Definitely could recommend!!"
50,"we had dinner as a family of 5. food was good. drinks were awesome, and the atmosphere is exactly as the name implies - ""chillling"""

50,"Great atmosphere, great food, great service - couldn't have asked for more! Truly exceptional cafe run to up-market western standards. Large, generous portions served by extra-helpful staff. A 'MUST visit' restaurant if you're passing though or visiting Ella!"
50,"We looove cafe chill! We went every day during our time in Ella. The food is amazing, the drinks are cheap and the service is great! Thank you so much to Sampa for being such a lovely waiter, you are such an asset to Cafe Chill!"
50,"Chill cafe is well worth the hype! The set up is cool and chilled (lol) although the atmosphere is lively and fun! Fab food at a very reasonable price, there’s something for everyone!! Although the waiters are super busy they are friendly and chatty; Vidal made our experience great! He was really smiley and chatty and he had an impressive memory!!"
50,We knew this was popular but it lived up to expectations and beat it. Our first night was on a Saturday and it was rammed but they found a place for us to look out on main St . Our second night was more chilled but equally good. The food is fantastic. The music is off the scale. And the service from Vidal was the best we have had in Sri Lanka. Seriously awesome place.
40,"Great atmosphere, lots of people good music, at times a bit loud.... staff are friendly, the place is welcoming.... other places nearby are virtually empty, everyone goes here..."

40,Me and my girlfriend decided to have dinner here because it is highly rated. You can have both Sri Lankan and Western food and the servers are very nice. Only thing is that we found it a bit too busy with all the people and the noise.
50,Chill restaurant is really great. The building is cool and the staff are all lovely and so helpful. Food was excellent. I asked for spicy curry and actually got it spicy for the first time in Sri Lanka. Our waiter Lasa was really great and fast. He was really polite too. The passion fruit mojito was amazing too.
50,We had read a lot about this place online and wanted to try it out and it turned out to be a fantastic experience. The restaurant itself is very well designed and funky. The cleanliness is outstanding even in the rains. The food was superb (We tried lumprais and the another Sri Lankan dish with 10 curries). Good quantity and very flavorful. The cocktails were our highlight. We tried the chilly cocktail and OMG it is absolutely Delicious for those who love a spicy. We were served by Upul who was super friendly and added to our experience with his wonderful smile.
50,"Well deserved western meal in a beautiful place in Sri Lanka! Served by Sampha who was so kind, so helpful and made us feel so welcome!! Deffo come back and ask for Sampha"

50,We orginally planned on a quick drink break but the lovely Rasika suggested some cheesecake and icecream. I loved my iced tea...so icy!
50,"We arrived in Ella and instantly noticed this place, big straw like hut after looking after 2 reviews I knew I had to try this out, fast WiFi, happy friendly service, amazing food, the staff will do anything to make your stay here pleasant, Lasa especially we ordered a iced coffee which was a bit too strong instantly changed it no worries, top guy... 100% would come back again and again"

50,"Ella is becoming very popular place in Sri Lanka and there are lots of local restaurants. Cafe Chill is by far the best place! Nice food, excellent service from my friend Sampa, nice music, very good cocktails at the roof top, which is also nice area to dine. They have local food as well as international. I was there twice!"
50,We stayed in Ella for 4 nights and had dinner and drinks here every night! The food is so good and then a few drinks on the beanbags afterwards is the perfect way to end a night. Every night we had great service. Chanchala and Vidal were so helpful and really added to our night by advising us on what to eat and drink! They really added to the great atmosphere already in the restaurant! We wanted to watch the Liverpool match and Vidal made sure we had a table in front of the TV with a perfect view of the game.Cafe Chill is definitely my favourite spot in Sri Lanka!From Ireland
50,"Had morning coffee here and came back for dinner. Amazing service from Vidal who was so busy but remembered our names. Excellent food, great atmosphere and Vidal was the best waiter I have seen. Definitely worth a visit here."

30,"I have a feeling that all tourists go there because see other tourists and feel safe because of this..Food is quite average. Place looks very nice but doesn’t have a “soul”. In my opinion you can’t feel there REAL local vibes and real local food.You have plenty of smaller restaurants all around but they are quite empty - everybody sits at chill cafe.We ate in 7 different restaurants and chill cafes was the worst of them.If you want to try local food, talk to local people in more quite atmosphere I would recommend different restaurants."
50,"Nice place, good atmosphere, good food (Greek salad and banana package), nice guy (Rumesh) who helped us :-)"
50,This was our first stop in Ella since it was highly recommended by our guide. Chill offers an extensive menu from traditional Sri Lankan rice and curry to Western hamburgers. There’s something for everyone. Relaxing atmosphere and great service (thanks Rumesh).
